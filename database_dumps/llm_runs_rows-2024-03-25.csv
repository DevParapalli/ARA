Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of deep learning model that are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to engage in a wide range of tasks related to language and information processing. They are typically much larger than traditional language models, often reaching tens of billions of parameters.

**Key Features:**

* **Generative Capabilities:** LLMs excel at generating text, code, images, and other media formats.
* **Transfer Learning:** LLMs can be fine-tuned for various tasks, including text summarization, translation, code generation, and information retrieval.
* **Contextual Awareness:** LLMs are adept at understanding and responding to complex contexts, often exceeding the capabilities of traditional language models.

**Examples:**

* **GPT-3:** A popular LLM known for its exceptional text generation capabilities and ability to engage in open-ended conversations.
* **GPT-Neo:** A large language model pre-trained on a massive dataset of text and code, offering strong performance in various tasks like code generation and information retrieval.
* **PaLM:** A powerful LLM designed specifically for scientific research, capable of generating high-quality code and explanations for complex scientific papers.

**Challenges:**

* **Bias:** LLMs can inherit biases from the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
* **Ethical Concerns:** LLMs raise ethical concerns about privacy, misinformation, and potential misuse.
* **Cost:** Training and deploying LLMs can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive.

**Future Outlook:**

LLMs are a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize various industries. Researchers are actively exploring ways to improve their capabilities, address their limitations, and make them more accessible.

The text has a total of 90 tokens, with 68 tokens from the prompt and 22 tokens from the response."",""wikipedia"":""**Title:** Hello\n\n**Summary:**\n\nHello is a salutation or greeting in the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826. The word is derived from the Old High German word halâ, hallo, or holâ.

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \nNor any day for food or play \nCame to the mariners' hollo!\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"".

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \nNor any day for food or play \nCame to the mariners' hollo!\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.Webster's dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of holloa to the Old English halow and suggests: \""Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\"".\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac"",""metadata"":{""title"":""Hello"",""summary"":""Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language.

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\\n\\n\\n== Early uses ==\\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, \\'whoa there!\\', from French là \\'there\\'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\\n\\n\\n=== Telephone ===\\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn\\'t immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\\n\\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as \\'hello-girls\\' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\\n\\n\\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\\n\\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\\nFowler\\'s has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\'s famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\\n\\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \\nNor any day for food or play \\nCame to the mariners\\' hollo!\\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.Webster\\'s dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of holloa to the Old English halow and suggests: \""Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\"".\\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac', metadata={'title': 'Hello', 'summary': 'Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language.

It is first attested in writing from 1826. The word is derived from the Old High German word halâ, hallo, or holâ. Hello is also related to the word halloo, hallo, and hollo.\n\nThe use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison. Before the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut.

As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone.

Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A.

Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864.

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \nNor any day for food or play \nCame to the mariners' hollo!\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.Webster's dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of holloa to the Old English halow and suggests: \""Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\"".\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac"",""metadata"":{""title"":""Hello"",""summary"":""Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language.

The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \nNor any day for food or play \nCame to the mariners' hollo!\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.Webster's dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of holloa to the Old English halow and suggests: \""Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\"".\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac"",""metadata"":{""title"":""Hello"",""summary"":""Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language.

It is first attested in writing from 1826. The word is derived from the Old High German word halâ, hallo, or holâ. Hello is also related to the word halloo, hallo, and hollo.\n\nThe use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison. Before the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.""},""response"":""## Analysis of the provided text\n\nThis text describes a simple greeting message and its analysis.

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette.

It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \nNor any day for food or play \nCame to the mariners' hollo!\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.Webster's dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of holloa to the Old English halow and suggests: \""Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\"".\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac"",""metadata"":{""title"":""Hello"",""summary"":""Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language.

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\nFowler's has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\n\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \nNor any day for food or play \nCame to the mariners' hollo!\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"".

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\\n\\n\\n== Early uses ==\\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, \\'whoa there!\\', from French là \\'there\\'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\\n\\n\\n=== Telephone ===\\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn\\'t immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\\n\\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as \\'hello-girls\\' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\\n\\n\\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\\n\\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in publications as early as 1803. The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa). The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:\\nIf I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.\\nFowler\\'s has it that \""hallo\"" is first recorded \""as a shout to call attention\"" in 1864. It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\'s famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:\\n\\nAnd the good south wind still blew behind,\\nBut no sweet bird did follow, \\nNor any day for food or play \\nCame to the mariners\\' hollo!\\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \""hallo\"" literally translates into English as \""hello\"". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.Webster\\'s dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of holloa to the Old English halow and suggests: \""Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā\"".\\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac', metadata={'title': 'Hello', 'summary': 'Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language.

The anthropic principle is a hypothesis that limits the range of possible observations of the universe due to the limitations of its capacity to accommodate conscious life. It posits that the universe is such that it is capable of supporting conscious life.

There are different formulations of the anthropic principle, including the weak anthropic principle (WAP) and the strong anthropic principle (SAP). The WAP states that the universe's fine-tuning is the result of selection bias. The SAP states that the universe is compelled to have conscious and sapient life emerge.

The anthropic principle has been criticized for lacking falsifiability and making assumptions about the nature of reality. It is also often used to argue against the existence of a multiverse.",

It was also announced that Microsoft will have a non-voting board seat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings ===\nIn December 2015, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research announced the formation of OpenAI and pledged over $1 billion to the venture. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019. According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, Musk was its largest donor while YC Research did not contribute anything at all. The organization stated it would \""freely collaborate\"" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. OpenAI is headquartered at the Pioneer Building in Mission District, San Francisco.According to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \""founding fathers\"" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the \""best researchers in the field\"". Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015. In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.Microsoft's Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect. OpenAI's potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI \""partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.\"" Brockman stated that \""the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.\"" OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down \""borderline crazy\"" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.In April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of \""OpenAI Gym\"", its platform for reinforcement learning research. Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 supercomputer to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours. In December 2016, OpenAI released \""Universe\"", a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites, and other applications.In 2017 OpenAI spent $7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone.

Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.\n\n\n== In-context learning ==\nPrompt engineering is enabled by in-context learning, defined as a model's ability to temporarily learn from prompts. The ability for in-context learning is an emergent ability of large language models. In-context learning itself is an emergent property of model scale, meaning breaks in downstream scaling laws occur such that its efficacy increases at a different rate in larger models than in smaller models.In contrast to training and fine tuning for each specific task, which are not temporary, what has been learnt during in-context learning is of a temporary nature. It does not carry the temporary contexts or biases, except the ones already present in the (pre)training dataset, from one conversation to the other. This result of \""mesa-optimization\"" within transformer layers, is a form of meta-learning or \""learning to learn\"".\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2021, researchers finetuned one generatively pretrained model (T0) on performing 12 NLP tasks (using 62 datasets, as each task can have multiple datasets) that showed good performance on new tasks, surpassing models trained directly on just performing one task (without pretraining). To solve a task, T0 is given the task in a structured prompt, for example If {{premise}} is true, is it also true that {{hypothesis}}? ||| {{entailed}}. is the prompt used for making T0 solve entailment.A repository for prompts reported that over 2,000 public prompts for around 170 datasets were available in February 2022.In 2022 the chain-of-thought prompting technique was proposed by Google researchers.In 2023 several text-to-text and text-to-image prompt databases were publicly available.\n\n\n== Text-to-text ==\n\n\n=== Chain-of-thought ===\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve a problem as a series of intermediate steps before giving a final answer. Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning ability by inducing the model to answer a multi-step problem with steps of reasoning that mimic a train of thought. It allows large language models to overcome difficulties with some reasoning tasks that require logical thinking and multiple steps to solve, such as arithmetic or commonsense reasoning questions.For example, given the question \""Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have?\"", a CoT prompt might induce the LLM to answer \""A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 9.\""As originally proposed, each CoT prompt included a few Q&A examples. This made it a few-shot prompting technique.

Why is LangChain important? How does LangChain work? What are the core components of LangChain? How can AWS help with your LangChain requirements? \n\nLangChain is an open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are large deep-learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate responses to user queries—for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts. LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the customization, accuracy, and relevancy of the information the models generate. For example, developers can use LangChain components to build new prompt chains or customize existing templates. LangChain also includes components that allow LLMs to access new data sets without retraining.\n\nWhy is LangChain important?\n\nLLMs excel at responding to prompts in a general context, but struggle in a specific domain they were never trained on. Prompts are queries people use to seek responses from an LLM. For example, an LLM can provide an answer to how much a computer costs by providing an estimate. However, it can't list the price of a specific computer model that your company sells. \n\nTo do that, machine learning engineers must integrate the LLM with the organization’s internal data sources and apply prompt engineering—a practice where a data scientist refines inputs to a generative model with a specific structure and context. \n\nLangChain streamlines intermediate steps to develop such data-responsive applications, making prompt engineering more efficient. It is designed to develop diverse applications powered by language models more effortlessly, including chatbots, question-answering, content generation, summarizers, and more.\n\nThe following sections describe benefits of LangChain.\n\nRepurpose language models\n\nWith LangChain, organizations can repurpose LLMs for domain-specific applications without retraining or fine-tuning. Development teams can build complex applications referencing proprietary information to augment model responses. For example, you can use LangChain to build applications that read data from stored internal documents and summarize them into conversational responses. You can create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow that introduces new information to the language model during prompting. Implementing context-aware workflows like RAG reduces model hallucination and improves response accuracy. \n\nSimplify AI development\n\nLangChain simplifies artificial intelligence (AI) development by abstracting the complexity of data source integrations and prompt refining. Developers can customize sequences to build complex applications quickly. Instead of programming business logic, software teams can modify templates and libraries that LangChain provides to reduce development time. \n\nLangChain provides AI developers with tools to connect language models with external data sources. It is open-source and supported by an active community. Organizations can use LangChain for free and receive support from other developers proficient in the framework.\n\nHow does LangChain work?\n\nWith LangChain, developers can adapt a language model flexibly to specific business contexts by designating steps required to produce the desired outcome. \n\nChains are the fundamental principle that holds various AI components in LangChain to provide context-aware responses. A chain is a series of automated actions from the user's query to the model's output. For example, developers can use a chain for:\n\nConnecting to different data sources.\n\nGenerating unique content.\n\nTranslating multiple languages.\n\nAnswering user queries. \n\nChains are made of links. Each action that developers string together to form a chained sequence is called a link. With links, developers can divide complex tasks into multiple, smaller tasks. Examples of links include:\n\nFormatting user input. \n\nSending a query to an LLM. \n\nRetrieving data from cloud storage.\n\nTranslating from one language to another.\n\nIn the LangChain framework, a link accepts input from the user and passes it to the LangChain libraries for processing. LangChain also allows link reordering to create different AI workflows. \n\nTo use LangChain, developers install the framework in Python with the following command:\n\npip install langchain \n\nDevelopers then use the chain building blocks or LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to compose chains with simple programming commands. The chain() function passes a link's arguments to the libraries. The execute() command retrieves the results. Developers can pass the current link result to the following link or return it as the final output. \n\nBelow is an example of a chatbot chain function that returns product details in multiple languages.\n\nretrieve_data_from_product_database().\n\nsend_data_to_language_model().\n\n format_output_in_a_list().\n\n translate_output_in_target_language()\n\nWhat are the core components of LangChain?\n\nUsing LangChain, software teams can build context-aware language model systems with the following modules. \n\nLangChain provides APIs with which developers can connect and query LLMs from their code. Developers can interface with public and proprietary models like GPT, Bard, and PaLM with LangChain by making simple API calls instead of writing complex code.\n\nPrompt templates are pre-built structures developers use to consistently and precisely format queries for AI models. Developers can create a prompt template for chatbot applications, few-shot learning, or deliver specific instructions to the language models. Moreover, they can reuse the templates across different applications and language models. \n\nDevelopers use tools and libraries that LangChain provides to compose and customize existing chains for complex applications. An agent is a special chain that prompts the language model to decide the best sequence in response to a query. When using an agent, developers provide the user's input, available tools, and possible intermediate steps to achieve the desired results. Then, the language model returns a viable sequence of actions the application can take. \n\nLangChain enables the architecting of RAG systems with numerous tools to transform, store, search, and retrieve information that refine language model responses. Developers can create semantic representations of information with word embeddings and store them in local or cloud vector databases. \n\nSome conversational language model applications refine their responses with information recalled from past interactions. LangChain allows developers to include memory capabilities in their systems. It supports:\n\nSimple memory systems that recall the most recent conversations. \n\nComplex memory structures that analyze historical messages to return the most relevant results. \n\nCallbacks are codes that developers place in their applications to log, monitor, and stream specific events in LangChain operations. For example, developers can track when a chain was first called and errors encountered with callbacks. \n\nHow can AWS help with your LangChain requirements? \n\nUsing Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Kendra, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, LangChain, and your LLMs, you can build highly-accurate generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) applications on enterprise data. LangChain is the interface that ties these components together:\n\nAmazon Bedrock is a managed service with which organizations can build and deploy generative AI applications. You can use Amazon Bedrock to set up a generational model, which you access from LangChain. \n\nAmazon Kendra is a machine learning (ML)-powered service that helps organizations perform internal searches. You can connect Amazon Kendra to LangChain, which uses data from proprietary databases to refine language model outputs. \n\nAmazon SageMaker Jumpstart is an ML hub that provides pre-built algorithms and foundational models that developers can deploy quickly.

Everything you need to know\n\nThe potential of AI technology has been percolating in the background for years. But when ChatGPT, the AI chatbot, began grabbing headlines in early 2023, it put generative AI in the spotlight. This guide is your go-to manual for generative AI, covering its benefits, limits, use cases, prospects and much more.\n\nShare this item with your network:\n\nCameron Hashemi-Pour, Site Editor\n\nLangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.\n\nDevelopers, software engineers and data scientists with experience in the Python, JavaScript or TypeScript programming languages can make use of LangChain's packages offered in those languages. LangChain was launched as an open source project by co-founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola in 2022; the initial version was released that same year.\n\nWhy is LangChain important?\n\nLangChain is a framework that simplifies the process of creating generative AI application interfaces. Developers working on these types of interfaces use various tools to create advanced NLP apps; LangChain streamlines this process. For example, LLMs have to access large volumes of big data, so LangChain organizes these large quantities of data so that they can be accessed with ease.\n\nIn addition, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are generally trained on data up to their release to the public. For instance, ChatGPT was released to the public near the end of 2022, but its knowledge base was limited to data from 2021 and before. LangChain can connect AI models to data sources to give them knowledge of recent data without limitations.\n\nThis article is part of\n\nWhat is generative AI? Everything you need to know\n\nWhich also includes:\n\n8 top generative AI tool categories for 2024\n\nWill AI replace jobs? 9 job types that might be affected\n\n16 of the best large language models\n\nWhat are the features of LangChain?\n\nLangChain is made up of the following modules that ensure the multiple components needed to make an effective NLP app can run smoothly:\n\nModel interaction. Also called model I/O, this module lets LangChain interact with any language model and perform tasks such as managing inputs to the model and extracting information from its outputs.\n\nData connection and retrieval. Data that LLMs access can be transformed, stored in databases and retrieved from those databases through queries with this module.\n\nChains. When using LangChain to build more complex apps, other components or even more than one LLM might be required. This module links multiple LLMs with other components or LLMs. This is referred to as an LLM chain.\n\nAgents. The agent module lets LLMs decide the best steps or actions to take to solve problems. It does so by orchestrating a series of complex commands to LLMs and other tools to get them to respond to specific requests.\n\nMemory. The memory module helps an LLM remember the context of its interactions with users. Both short-term memory and long-term memory can be added to a model, depending on the specific use.\n\nWhat are the integrations of LangChain?\n\nLangChain typically builds applications using integrations with LLM providers and external sources where data can be found and stored. For example, LangChain can build chatbots or question-answering systems by integrating an LLM -- such as those from Hugging Face, Cohere and OpenAI -- with data sources or stores such as Apify Actors, Google Search and Wikipedia. This enables an app to take user-input text, process it and retrieve the best answers from any of these sources. In this sense, LangChain integrations make use of the most up-to-date NLP technology to build effective apps.\n\nOther potential integrations include cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as vector databases. A vector database can store large volumes of high-dimensional data -- such as videos, images and long-form text -- as mathematical representations that make it easier for an application to query and search for those data elements. Pinecone is an example vector database that can be integrated with LangChain.\n\nLangChain augments existing large language models so that they are equipped to handle user queries and prompts.\n\nHow to create prompts in LangChain\n\nPrompts serve as input to the LLM that instructs it to return a response, which is often an answer to a query. This response is also referred to as an output. A prompt must be designed and executed correctly to increase the likelihood of a well-written and accurate response from a language model. That is why prompt engineering is an emerging science that has received more attention in recent years.\n\nPrompts can be generated easily in LangChain implementations using a prompt template, which will be used as instructions for the underlying LLM. Prompt templates can vary in specificity. They can be designed to pose simple questions to a language model. They can also be used to provide a set of explicit instructions to a language model with enough detail and examples to retrieve a high-quality response.\n\nWith Python programming, LangChain has a premade prompt template that takes the form of structured text. The following steps are required to use this:\n\nInstalling Python. A recent version of Python must be installed. Once the Python shell terminal is open, enter the following command to install just the bare minimum requirements of LangChain for the sake of this example.\n\npip install langchain\n\nAdding integrations. LangChain typically requires at least one integration. OpenAI is a prime example. To use OpenAI's LLM application programming interfaces, a developer must create an account on the OpenAI website and retrieve the API access key. Then, using the following code snippet, install OpenAI's Python package and enter the key for access to the APIs.\n\npip install openai from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\""...\"")\n\nImporting the prompt template. Once these basic steps are complete, LangChain's prompt template method must then be imported. The code snippet shown below does this.\n\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( \""Tell me an {adjective} fact about {content}.\"" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=\""interesting\"", content=\""zebras\"") \""Tell me an interesting fact about zebras.\""\n\nIn this scenario, the language model would be expected to take the two input variables -- the adjective and the content -- and produce a fascinating fact about zebras as its output.\n\nHow to develop applications in LangChain\n\nLangChain is built to develop apps powered by language model functionality. There are different ways to do this, but the process typically entails some key steps:\n\nDefine the application. An application developer must first define a specific use case for the application. This also means determining its scope, including requirements such as any needed integrations, components and LLMs.\n\nBuild functionality. Developers use prompts to build the functionality or logic of the intended app.\n\nCustomize functionality. LangChain lets developers modify its code to create customized functionality that meets the needs of the use case and shapes the application's behavior.\n\nFine-tuning LLMs. It's important to choose the appropriate LLM for the job and also to fine-tune it to adhere to the needs of the use case.\n\nData cleansing. Using data cleansing techniques ensures clean and accurate data sets. Also, security measures should be implemented to protect sensitive data.\n\nTesting.

The most obvious use case would be customer support chatbots. LangChain enables chat applications that are advanced enough to handle complex questions and even transactions from users. These applications are able to understand and maintain a user's context throughout a conversation in the same way ChatGPT can. AI is already being widely used to enhance customer experience and service.\n\nCoding assistants. It's possible to build coding assistants with the help of LangChain. Using LangChain and OpenAI's API, developers can create a tool to assist those in the tech sector with enhancing their coding skills and improving productivity.\n\nHealthcare. AI has made its way into healthcare in several ways. LLM-centric LangChain applications are helping doctors make diagnoses. They're also automating rote, repetitive administrative tasks, such as scheduling patient appointments, enabling healthcare workers to focus on more important work.\n\nMarketing and e-commerce. Businesses use e-commerce platforms with LLM functionality to better engage customers and expand their customer base. An application that can understand consumer purchasing patterns and product descriptions can generate product recommendations and compelling descriptions for potential customers.\n\nReaping the benefits of NLP is a key of why LangChain is important. For a more in-depth understanding of NLP, there are two important subtopics to start with: natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG).

Everything you need to know\n\nThe potential of AI technology has been percolating in the background for years. But when ChatGPT, the AI chatbot, began grabbing headlines in early 2023, it put generative AI in the spotlight. This guide is your go-to manual for generative AI, covering its benefits, limits, use cases, prospects and much more.\n\nShare this item with your network:\n\nCameron Hashemi-Pour, Site Editor\n\nLangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.\n\nDevelopers, software engineers and data scientists with experience in the Python, JavaScript or TypeScript programming languages can make use of LangChain's packages offered in those languages. LangChain was launched as an open source project by co-founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola in 2022; the initial version was released that same year.\n\nWhy is LangChain important?\n\nLangChain is a framework that simplifies the process of creating generative AI application interfaces. Developers working on these types of interfaces use various tools to create advanced NLP apps; LangChain streamlines this process. For example, LLMs have to access large volumes of big data, so LangChain organizes these large quantities of data so that they can be accessed with ease.\n\nIn addition, GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models are generally trained on data up to their release to the public. For instance, ChatGPT was released to the public near the end of 2022, but its knowledge base was limited to data from 2021 and before. LangChain can connect AI models to data sources to give them knowledge of recent data without limitations.\n\nThis article is part of\n\nWhat is generative AI? Everything you need to know\n\nWhich also includes:\n\n8 top generative AI tool categories for 2024\n\nWill AI replace jobs? 9 job types that might be affected\n\n16 of the best large language models\n\nWhat are the features of LangChain?\n\nLangChain is made up of the following modules that ensure the multiple components needed to make an effective NLP app can run smoothly:\n\nModel interaction. Also called model I/O, this module lets LangChain interact with any language model and perform tasks such as managing inputs to the model and extracting information from its outputs.\n\nData connection and retrieval. Data that LLMs access can be transformed, stored in databases and retrieved from those databases through queries with this module.\n\nChains. When using LangChain to build more complex apps, other components or even more than one LLM might be required. This module links multiple LLMs with other components or LLMs. This is referred to as an LLM chain.\n\nAgents. The agent module lets LLMs decide the best steps or actions to take to solve problems. It does so by orchestrating a series of complex commands to LLMs and other tools to get them to respond to specific requests.\n\nMemory. The memory module helps an LLM remember the context of its interactions with users. Both short-term memory and long-term memory can be added to a model, depending on the specific use.\n\nWhat are the integrations of LangChain?\n\nLangChain typically builds applications using integrations with LLM providers and external sources where data can be found and stored. For example, LangChain can build chatbots or question-answering systems by integrating an LLM -- such as those from Hugging Face, Cohere and OpenAI -- with data sources or stores such as Apify Actors, Google Search and Wikipedia. This enables an app to take user-input text, process it and retrieve the best answers from any of these sources. In this sense, LangChain integrations make use of the most up-to-date NLP technology to build effective apps.\n\nOther potential integrations include cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, as well as vector databases. A vector database can store large volumes of high-dimensional data -- such as videos, images and long-form text -- as mathematical representations that make it easier for an application to query and search for those data elements. Pinecone is an example vector database that can be integrated with LangChain.\n\nLangChain augments existing large language models so that they are equipped to handle user queries and prompts.\n\nHow to create prompts in LangChain\n\nPrompts serve as input to the LLM that instructs it to return a response, which is often an answer to a query. This response is also referred to as an output. A prompt must be designed and executed correctly to increase the likelihood of a well-written and accurate response from a language model. That is why prompt engineering is an emerging science that has received more attention in recent years.\n\nPrompts can be generated easily in LangChain implementations using a prompt template, which will be used as instructions for the underlying LLM. Prompt templates can vary in specificity. They can be designed to pose simple questions to a language model. They can also be used to provide a set of explicit instructions to a language model with enough detail and examples to retrieve a high-quality response.\n\nWith Python programming, LangChain has a premade prompt template that takes the form of structured text. The following steps are required to use this:\n\nInstalling Python. A recent version of Python must be installed. Once the Python shell terminal is open, enter the following command to install just the bare minimum requirements of LangChain for the sake of this example.\n\npip install langchain\n\nAdding integrations. LangChain typically requires at least one integration. OpenAI is a prime example. To use OpenAI's LLM application programming interfaces, a developer must create an account on the OpenAI website and retrieve the API access key. Then, using the following code snippet, install OpenAI's Python package and enter the key for access to the APIs.\n\npip install openai from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\""...\"")\n\nImporting the prompt template. Once these basic steps are complete, LangChain's prompt template method must then be imported. The code snippet shown below does this.\n\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( \""Tell me an {adjective} fact about {content}.\"" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=\""interesting\"", content=\""zebras\"") \""Tell me an interesting fact about zebras.\""\n\nIn this scenario, the language model would be expected to take the two input variables -- the adjective and the content -- and produce a fascinating fact about zebras as its output.\n\nHow to develop applications in LangChain\n\nLangChain is built to develop apps powered by language model functionality. There are different ways to do this, but the process typically entails some key steps:\n\nDefine the application. An application developer must first define a specific use case for the application. This also means determining its scope, including requirements such as any needed integrations, components and LLMs.\n\nBuild functionality. Developers use prompts to build the functionality or logic of the intended app.\n\nCustomize functionality. LangChain lets developers modify its code to create customized functionality that meets the needs of the use case and shapes the application's behavior.\n\nFine-tuning LLMs. It's important to choose the appropriate LLM for the job and also to fine-tune it to adhere to the needs of the use case.\n\nData cleansing. Using data cleansing techniques ensures clean and accurate data sets. Also, security measures should be implemented to protect sensitive data.\n\nTesting. Regularly testing LangChain apps ensures they continue to run smoothly.\n\nFor more information on generative AI-related terms, read the following articles:\n\nWhat is an AI prompt engineer?\n\nWhat is prompt engineering?\n\nWhat is synthetic data?\n\nExamples and use cases for LangChain\n\nThe LLM-based applications LangChain is capable of building can be applied to multiple advanced use cases within various industries and vertical markets, such as the following:\n\nCustomer service chatbots. The most obvious use case would be customer support chatbots. LangChain enables chat applications that are advanced enough to handle complex questions and even transactions from users.

Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and virtual agents.\n\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\n\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\n\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\nIntegrations with LLMs\n\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\n\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\n\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\n\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\n\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks like LangChain and the IBM watsonx platform greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\nIBM named a leader by Gartner\n\nRead why IBM was named a leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud AI Developer Services report.\n\nRegister for the guide on foundation models\n\nHow does LangChain work?\n\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\n\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\n\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\nImporting language models\n\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\n\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\n\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\n\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class (link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\n\nExplore the demo: using watsonx and LangChain to make a series of calls to a language model\n\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\n\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered. You can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\n\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\n\nWatch the video: prompt engineering and prompt tuning\n\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\n\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\n\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\n\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\n\nDocument loaders LangChain offers a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications (link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\n\nVector databases Unlike “traditional” structured databases, vector databases represent data points by converting them into vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\n\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\n\nText splitters To increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s TextSplitters split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\n\nRetrieval Once external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers retrieval augmented generation (RAG): its retriever modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of Document’s as output.\n\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n most recent exchanges.\n\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\n\na list of available tools to be leveraged.\n\nuser input (like prompts and queries).\n\nany relevant previously executed steps.\n\nLearn more about agents in LangChain\n\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\n\nLangChain tools (link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent LangChain tools include:\n\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\n\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\n\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\n\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\n\nReleased in the fall of 2023, LangSmith aims to bridge the gap between the accessible prototyping capabilities that brought LangChain to prominence and building production-quality LLM applications.\n\nLangSmith provides tools to monitor, evaluate and debug applications, including the ability to automatically trace all model calls to spot errors and test performance under different model configurations. This visibility aims to empower more robust, cost-efficient applications.\n\nGetting started with LangChain\n\nLangChain is open source and free to use: source code is available for download on Github (link resides outside ibm.com).\n\nLangChain can also be installed on Python with a simple pip command: pip install langchain. To install all LangChain dependencies (rather than only those you find necessary), you can run the command pip install langchain[all].\n\nMany step-by-step tutorials are available from both the greater LangChain community ecosystem and the official documentation at docs.langchain.com (link resides outside ibm.com).\n\nApplications made with LangChain provide great utility for a variety of use cases, from straightforward question-answering and text generation tasks to more complex solutions that use an LLM as a “reasoning engine.”\n\nChatbots: Chatbots are among the most intuitive uses of LLMs. LangChain can be used to provide proper context for the specific use of a chatbot, and to integrate chatbots into existing communication channels and workflows with their own APIs.\n\nSummarization: Language models can be tasked with summarizing many types of text, from breaking down complex academic articles and transcripts to providing a digest of incoming emails.\n\nQuestion answering: Using specific documents or specialized knowledge bases (like Wolfram, arXiv or PubMed), LLMs can retrieve relevant information from storage and articulate helpful answers). If fine-tuned or properly prompted, some LLMs can answer many questions even without external information.\n\nData augmentation: LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for use in machine learning. For example, an LLM can be trained to generate additional data samples that closely resemble the data points in a training dataset.\n\nVirtual agents: Integrated with the right workflows, LangChain’s Agent modules can use an LLM to autonomously determine next steps and take action using robotic process automation (RPA).\n\nTrain, validate, tune and deploy generative AI, foundation models and machine learning capabilities with ease and build AI applications in a fraction of the time with a fraction of the data.\n\nAI consulting services\n\nReimagine how you work with AI: our diverse, global team of more than 20,000 AI experts can help you quickly and confidently design and scale AI and automation across your business, working across our own IBM watsonx technology and an open ecosystem of partners to deliver any AI model, on any cloud, guided by ethics and trust.\n\nExplore IBM AI consulting services\n\nScale analytics and AI workloads for all your data, anywhere with watsonx.data, the industry’s only data store that is open, hybrid and governed.\n\nExplore watsonx.data\n\nTools, tips and sample code to begin building applications with LangChain and watsonx.\n\nTips for writing foundation model prompts\n\nPart art, part science, prompt engineering is the process of crafting prompt text to best effect for a given model and parameters.

This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\n\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\n\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\nIntegrations with LLMs\n\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\n\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\n\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\n\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\n\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks like LangChain and the IBM watsonx platform greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\nIBM named a leader by Gartner\n\nRead why IBM was named a leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud AI Developer Services report.\n\nRegister for the guide on foundation models\n\nHow does LangChain work?\n\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\n\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\n\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\nImporting language models\n\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\n\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\n\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\n\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class (link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\n\nExplore the demo: using watsonx and LangChain to make a series of calls to a language model\n\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\n\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered. You can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\n\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\n\nWatch the video: prompt engineering and prompt tuning\n\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\n\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\n\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\n\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\n\nDocument loaders LangChain offers a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications (link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\n\nVector databases Unlike “traditional” structured databases, vector databases represent data points by converting them into vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\n\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\n\nText splitters To increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s TextSplitters split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\n\nRetrieval Once external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers retrieval augmented generation (RAG): its retriever modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of Document’s as output.\n\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n most recent exchanges.\n\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\n\na list of available tools to be leveraged.\n\nuser input (like prompts and queries).\n\nany relevant previously executed steps.\n\nLearn more about agents in LangChain\n\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\n\nLangChain tools (link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent LangChain tools include:\n\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\n\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\n\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\n\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\n\nReleased in the fall of 2023, LangSmith aims to bridge the gap between the accessible prototyping capabilities that brought LangChain to prominence and building production-quality LLM applications.\n\nLangSmith provides tools to monitor, evaluate and debug applications, including the ability to automatically trace all model calls to spot errors and test performance under different model configurations. This visibility aims to empower more robust, cost-efficient applications.\n\nGetting started with LangChain\n\nLangChain is open source and free to use: source code is available for download on Github (link resides outside ibm.com).\n\nLangChain can also be installed on Python with a simple pip command: pip install langchain. To install all LangChain dependencies (rather than only those you find necessary), you can run the command pip install langchain[all].\n\nMany step-by-step tutorials are available from both the greater LangChain community ecosystem and the official documentation at docs.langchain.com (link resides outside ibm.com).\n\nApplications made with LangChain provide great utility for a variety of use cases, from straightforward question-answering and text generation tasks to more complex solutions that use an LLM as a “reasoning engine.”\n\nChatbots: Chatbots are among the most intuitive uses of LLMs. LangChain can be used to provide proper context for the specific use of a chatbot, and to integrate chatbots into existing communication channels and workflows with their own APIs.\n\nSummarization: Language models can be tasked with summarizing many types of text, from breaking down complex academic articles and transcripts to providing a digest of incoming emails.\n\nQuestion answering: Using specific documents or specialized knowledge bases (like Wolfram, arXiv or PubMed), LLMs can retrieve relevant information from storage and articulate helpful answers). If fine-tuned or properly prompted, some LLMs can answer many questions even without external information.\n\nData augmentation: LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for use in machine learning. For example, an LLM can be trained to generate additional data samples that closely resemble the data points in a training dataset.\n\nVirtual agents: Integrated with the right workflows, LangChain’s Agent modules can use an LLM to autonomously determine next steps and take action using robotic process automation (RPA).\n\nTrain, validate, tune and deploy generative AI, foundation models and machine learning capabilities with ease and build AI applications in a fraction of the time with a fraction of the data.\n\nAI consulting services\n\nReimagine how you work with AI: our diverse, global team of more than 20,000 AI experts can help you quickly and confidently design and scale AI and automation across your business, working across our own IBM watsonx technology and an open ecosystem of partners to deliver any AI model, on any cloud, guided by ethics and trust.\n\nExplore IBM AI consulting services\n\nScale analytics and AI workloads for all your data, anywhere with watsonx.data, the industry’s only data store that is open, hybrid and governed.\n\nExplore watsonx.data\n\nTools, tips and sample code to begin building applications with LangChain and watsonx.\n\nTips for writing foundation model prompts\n\nPart art, part science, prompt engineering is the process of crafting prompt text to best effect for a given model and parameters.

Getting Started with LangChain | DataStax"",""snippet"":""Guide • Nov 09, 2023\n\nWhat is LangChain? Understanding Key Components and Principles\n\nLangChain aids in implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern in applications, simplifying data retrieval from various sources. How does this contribute to more contextually aware AI applications?Sign Up for Astra\n\nAI Developer Advocate\n\nLangChain is a Python framework designed to streamline AI application development, focusing on real-time data processing and integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers features for data communication, generation of vector embeddings, and simplifies the interaction with LLMs, making it efficient for AI developers.\n\nWhen you refer to an application as “AI” that usually means it includes interactions with a learning model (like a large language model LLM). The [not so] interesting fact is that the use of an LLM is not actually what makes the app intelligent. It’s the use of a neural network in real time that makes it special. It just so happens that LLMs are built using neural networks. An AI application typically processes data in real-time. That means, that while it has a lot of pre-trained knowledge, it can take in data as it’s submitted to the application and give the LLM up-to-date information.\n\nAlternatives to an “AI Application” are those that include the use of a machine learning model(s). Those apps are still very intelligent but their data processing is more limited to what it has already been trained on. There’s not much real-time information. Pre-training a model versus using a neural network might seem like a minor subtlety because they both appear to be doing the same thing; however, in the data science field, this is a big difference.\n\nAI applications are usually a group of steps that process data as it’s received. When you click to view an item on an e-commerce website, that click event is sent to the website and is processed through an AI Application to decide on other “suggested items” that should be shown on the page. In case you were wondering, yes they are watching. The application would be given the context of what the item being viewed is, what’s in your cart, and the previous things you have viewed and shown interest in. All that data would be given to an LLM to decide on other items you might be interested in.\n\nHigh-level View of LangChain\n\nWhen you’re building an application like this, the steps in the pipeline choreograph what services should be included, how they will be “fed” the data, and what “shape” the data will take. As you can imagine these are complex actions that require APIs, data structure, network access, security, and a whole lot more.\n\nLangChain is a Python framework that helps someone build an AI Application and simplify all the requirements without having to code all the little details. An example of this is interacting with an LLM. Once all the information is together in a nice neat prompt, you’ll want to submit it to the LLM for completion. LangChain provides pre-built libraries for popular LLMs (like OpenAI GPT) so all a programmer has to do is provide their credentials and the prompt and wait for a response. They don’t need to worry about any of OpenAI’s API specifics like endpoints, protocols, and authentication.\n\nBut… LLM interaction is just the beginning of what LangChain can help with. Let’s look at why it is important before diving into some of the framework’s key features.\n\nWhy is LangChain Important?\n\nLangChain is important because it represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP). It offers an innovative framework for integrating various language models and tools. This integration enables the construction of more complex and sophisticated AI applications than previously possible. By leveraging LangChain, developers can create AI systems capable of understanding, reasoning, and interacting in ways that closely mimic human communication. This capability is crucial for applications requiring a deep comprehension of language and context.\n\nThe significance of LangChain extends to its potential impact across multiple industries. In areas such as customer service, content creation, and data analysis, LangChain can enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and contextual relevance of AI interactions. Its ability to bridge the communication gap between humans and machines opens up new possibilities for the integration of AI into everyday tasks and processes. LangChain's contribution lies in making AI more accessible, intuitive, and useful in a wide array of practical applications.\n\nWhat are the Key Components of LangChain?\n\nLangChain is a sophisticated framework comprising several key components that work in synergy to enhance natural language processing tasks. These components enable the system to effectively understand, process, and generate human-like language responses. Each component plays a distinct role in the overall functionality of LangChain.\n\nLLMs (Large Language Models)\n\nLLMs are the backbone of LangChain, providing the core capability for understanding and generating language. They are trained on vast datasets to produce text that is coherent and contextually relevant.\n\nPrompt templates in LangChain are designed to efficiently interact with LLMs. They structure the input in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of the language models in understanding and responding to queries.\n\nIndexes in LangChain serve as databases, organizing and storing information in a structured manner. This enables efficient retrieval of relevant data when the system processes language queries.\n\nRetrievers work alongside indexes. Their function is to quickly fetch the relevant information from the indexes based on the input query, ensuring that the response generation is informed and accurate.\n\nOutput parsers process the language generated by LLMs. They help in refining the output into a format that is useful and relevant to the specific task at hand.\n\nThe vector store in LangChain handles the embedding of words or phrases into numerical vectors. This is crucial for tasks involving semantic analysis and understanding the nuances of language.\n\nAgents in LangChain are the decision-making components. They determine the best course of action based on the input, the context, and the available resources within the system.\n\nWhat are the Main Features of LangChain?\n\nBelow is a summary of the most popular features of LangChain. This is not an exhaustive list of all that LangChain has to offer, but a curated list to call out some of its best features.\n\nCommunicating with Models\n\nWhen building AI applications you’ll need a way to communicate with a model. Probably a large language model (LLM). In addition, you might want to generate vector embeddings when your app is following a RAG pattern, submit a prompt for the LLM to complete, or open a chat session with the model. LangChain has specifically focused on common interactions with a model and made it very easy to create a complete solution. Learn more about models and which LLMs LangChain supports\n\nTypically the application is going to be doing the same action again and again. The prompt used to communicate with a model will have certain text that stays the same no matter what the real-time data is. LangChain has a special prompts library to help parameterize common prompt text. That means the prompts can have placeholders for areas that will be filled in right before submitting the LLM. Instead of doing a very inefficient string replacement on the prompt, you provide LangChain with a map of each placeholder and its value. It will take care of efficiently getting the prompt ready for completion. Learn more about prompts\n\nOnce the model has done its job and responded with the completion, there’s a good chance the application is going to need to do some post-processing before continuing. There might be some simple cleanup of characters or (most likely) the completion needs to be included in a parameter of a class object. LangChain's output parsers make quick work of this by offering a deep integration between how the LLM will respond and the application’s custom classes. Learn more about output parsers\n\nWhen a model is created, it’s trained with some data set. A model is considered small or large based on the amount of data that was used during training. For example, LLMs like GPT have been trained on the entire public internet. That amount of data deserves the “Large” label. The challenge is that no matter how much data a model is trained with it’s still a fixed amount. The data doesn’t stop following after the model is finished.\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an application design where the application first compares input data to other recent data to gain a better context. Then that up-to-date context is provided to the LLM to provide an up-to-date response. But it’s not as simple as a quick query and continuing to interact with the LLM. There are a few intermediate steps that have to happen. Also, data has to be stored in an understood format so that retrieval of that data is simple and consistent.\n\nLangChain offers a few libraries to aid in implementing the RAG pattern in an application. First, to gain the right context, data might need to come from different sources. Each source likely follows a different schema. LangChain offers the “document” object as a way to “normalize” data coming from multiple different sources. As a document, data can easily be passed between different chains in a very structured way.\n\nThe store that is used to look up up-to-date context is not your typical relational database. It’s a special version of the database that offers to store and retrieve vectors. Most modern databases like AstraDB offer a vector option. There are also vector-specific databases that are built for only the purpose of storing vector embeddings. LangChain offers integrations for all of the popular vector stores, including AstraDB. It also takes things quite a bit further by offering some very convenient features specific to vector search, like Similarity search and Similarity search by vector. You can tune your vector searches with Maximum marginal relevance search. This comes in quite handy when you want to get that context just right - not too much data and not too little data provided to the LLM.\n\nThese days chatbots are all the rage. It’s the “hello world” of AI application development. Thinking about the “chat” concept, when you are chatting with a friend, the conversation has a certain flow to it. As it progresses you both share the history of what has already been said. This helps move the conversation forward.\n\nWhen an AI Application is chatting with an LLM, it needs to give the LLM some historical information (context) about what is being asked. If no context is given the conversation is going to be quite dry and not very productive. In the previous data retrieval section the RAG pattern was described as a way to add this context.\n\nSometimes, though, the context needs to be in the moment. When you are chatting with your friend chances are you are not taking notes, trying to remember every word that was said. The conversation becomes a lecture if you were to do this - which is not that much fun. The same goes for a chat with the LLM.\n\nLangChain offers a special memory library where the application can save a chat’s history to a fast lookup store. The data is stored in a specific way, in a type of store that can offer very quick lookups. Typically is not a relational database. It’s usually a NoSQL or in-memory store.\n\nHaving the ability to quickly retrieve a chat’s history and inject it into the LLM’s prompt is a powerful way of creating very intelligent contextual applications.\n\nHow Does LangChain Work?\n\nWhen you pay with a credit card for something, certain steps need to happen in a specific order. First, the card information needs to be gathered and secured. Then it needs to be transmitted to a processor. The processor makes sure the card account is valid and that the funds are available. The processor transfers the funds from your account to the merchant’s account. Finally, a confirmation of all this is transmitted back and you are given a receipt. Each of those steps must be followed in a specific order. You can’t withdraw the funds from an account with no money in it. The same goes for interacting with an LLM. You can’t send a prompt to the LLM with no context. You’re just doing an internet search at that point.\n\nThe “chain” in LangChain brings the idea of putting AI actions together in order, to create a processing pipeline. Each action, or chain, is a needed step in the pipeline to complete the overall goal. Thinking about the RAG pattern, it starts with the user submitting a question. An embedding is created from that text, a lookup is done on a vector database to gain more context about the question, then a prompt is created using both the original question and the context from the retrieval. The prompt is submitted to the LLM, which responds with an intelligent completion of the prompt.\n\nAll the steps in the RAG pattern need to happen in succession. If anything errors along the way, the processing should stop. LangChain offers the “chain” construct to attach steps together in a specific way with a specific configuration. All LangChain libraries follow this chain construct to make it very easy to move steps around and create powerful processing pipelines.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Using LangChain?\n\nUsing LangChain offers several benefits in the realm of natural language processing.\n\nEnhanced Language Understanding and Generation\n\nLangChain's integration of various language models and tools allows for more sophisticated language processing. This leads to better understanding and generation of human-like language, especially in complex tasks.\n\nCustomization and Flexibility\n\nThe modular structure of LangChain offers significant customization options. This adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, allowing users to tailor language processing solutions to specific needs.\n\nStreamlined Development Process\n\nLangChain's framework simplifies the development of language processing systems. By chaining different components together, it reduces complexity and accelerates the creation of advanced applications.\n\nImproved Efficiency and Accuracy\n\nThe use of LangChain in language tasks enhances both efficiency and accuracy. The framework's ability to combine multiple language processing components leads to quicker and more accurate outcomes.\n\nVersatility Across Sectors\n\nLangChain's adaptability makes it valuable across various sectors, including content creation, customer service, and data analytics. Its ability to handle diverse language tasks makes it a versatile tool in the AI toolkit.\n\nExamples of LangChain Applications\n\nLangChain provides a lot of power by providing a framework that can be used to build generative AI applications. There are a number of different types of genAI applications where LangChain has been purpose built to facilitate.\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\nLangChain offers a few different scenarios that implement the RAG pattern. There is a simple question/answer example that is a classic use of adding context to a prompt. There is also the RAG over code example that aids developers while writing code. The Chat History example creates a very intelligent chat experience with the LLM. Visit LangChain’s use cases area for more.\n\nChatbots are the cornerstone of LLM interactions. LangChain offers a getting-started example, to help you create an AI Application in just a few minutes.\n\nBuild Production Gen AI Chat with Vertex.ai, LangChain and Astra DB Vector Search\n\nLearn how to build an enterprise customer service chatbot that uses Vertex.ai embedding and RAG with LangChain and Astra DB vector search in this free webinar.\n\nSynthetic Data Generation\n\nWhile developing applications, an engineer writes tests to ensure all their functions are working as expected. These are referred to as unit tests. There are also load tests a developer does to ensure the application can handle the load it will see in production. To run either of these tests you need data. Sometimes lots of data. LangChain’s Synthetic data generation example uses an LLM to artificially generate data. A developer could then use that data to test their application.\n\nInteracting with a Database Using Natural Language\n\nWriting SQL queries is not as much fun as it sounds. As one writes a query, they are taking a real-world question and transforming it into SQL syntax. A simple question like “How many chunks can a woodchuck chuck” would be transformed into “select count(chunk) from chunks where animal like ‘woodchuck’”. LangChain’s SQL example uses an LLM to transform a natural language question into a SQL dialect.\n\nGetting Started with LangChain\n\nWhether you have an existing Python app that needs to be taught new AI tricks or you’re starting from scratch, you’ll want to add the LangChain library to the requirements.\n\nUnknown block type \""blockCode\"", please specify a serializer for it in the `serializers.types` prop\n\nAssuming that you plan to interact with an LLM, the next step would be to install its supporting library. View the full list of LLMs here.\n\nUnknown block type \""blockCode\"", please specify a serializer for it in the `serializers.types` prop\n\nWith that, the fun begins!

Pre-training a model versus using a neural network might seem like a minor subtlety because they both appear to be doing the same thing; however, in the data science field, this is a big difference.\n\nAI applications are usually a group of steps that process data as it’s received. When you click to view an item on an e-commerce website, that click event is sent to the website and is processed through an AI Application to decide on other “suggested items” that should be shown on the page. In case you were wondering, yes they are watching. The application would be given the context of what the item being viewed is, what’s in your cart, and the previous things you have viewed and shown interest in. All that data would be given to an LLM to decide on other items you might be interested in.\n\nHigh-level View of LangChain\n\nWhen you’re building an application like this, the steps in the pipeline choreograph what services should be included, how they will be “fed” the data, and what “shape” the data will take. As you can imagine these are complex actions that require APIs, data structure, network access, security, and a whole lot more.\n\nLangChain is a Python framework that helps someone build an AI Application and simplify all the requirements without having to code all the little details. An example of this is interacting with an LLM. Once all the information is together in a nice neat prompt, you’ll want to submit it to the LLM for completion. LangChain provides pre-built libraries for popular LLMs (like OpenAI GPT) so all a programmer has to do is provide their credentials and the prompt and wait for a response. They don’t need to worry about any of OpenAI’s API specifics like endpoints, protocols, and authentication.\n\nBut… LLM interaction is just the beginning of what LangChain can help with. Let’s look at why it is important before diving into some of the framework’s key features.\n\nWhy is LangChain Important?\n\nLangChain is important because it represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP). It offers an innovative framework for integrating various language models and tools. This integration enables the construction of more complex and sophisticated AI applications than previously possible. By leveraging LangChain, developers can create AI systems capable of understanding, reasoning, and interacting in ways that closely mimic human communication. This capability is crucial for applications requiring a deep comprehension of language and context.\n\nThe significance of LangChain extends to its potential impact across multiple industries. In areas such as customer service, content creation, and data analysis, LangChain can enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and contextual relevance of AI interactions. Its ability to bridge the communication gap between humans and machines opens up new possibilities for the integration of AI into everyday tasks and processes. LangChain's contribution lies in making AI more accessible, intuitive, and useful in a wide array of practical applications.\n\nWhat are the Key Components of LangChain?\n\nLangChain is a sophisticated framework comprising several key components that work in synergy to enhance natural language processing tasks. These components enable the system to effectively understand, process, and generate human-like language responses. Each component plays a distinct role in the overall functionality of LangChain.\n\nLLMs (Large Language Models)\n\nLLMs are the backbone of LangChain, providing the core capability for understanding and generating language. They are trained on vast datasets to produce text that is coherent and contextually relevant.\n\nPrompt templates in LangChain are designed to efficiently interact with LLMs. They structure the input in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of the language models in understanding and responding to queries.\n\nIndexes in LangChain serve as databases, organizing and storing information in a structured manner. This enables efficient retrieval of relevant data when the system processes language queries.\n\nRetrievers work alongside indexes. Their function is to quickly fetch the relevant information from the indexes based on the input query, ensuring that the response generation is informed and accurate.\n\nOutput parsers process the language generated by LLMs. They help in refining the output into a format that is useful and relevant to the specific task at hand.\n\nThe vector store in LangChain handles the embedding of words or phrases into numerical vectors. This is crucial for tasks involving semantic analysis and understanding the nuances of language.\n\nAgents in LangChain are the decision-making components. They determine the best course of action based on the input, the context, and the available resources within the system.\n\nWhat are the Main Features of LangChain?\n\nBelow is a summary of the most popular features of LangChain. This is not an exhaustive list of all that LangChain has to offer, but a curated list to call out some of its best features.\n\nCommunicating with Models\n\nWhen building AI applications you’ll need a way to communicate with a model. Probably a large language model (LLM). In addition, you might want to generate vector embeddings when your app is following a RAG pattern, submit a prompt for the LLM to complete, or open a chat session with the model. LangChain has specifically focused on common interactions with a model and made it very easy to create a complete solution. Learn more about models and which LLMs LangChain supports\n\nTypically the application is going to be doing the same action again and again. The prompt used to communicate with a model will have certain text that stays the same no matter what the real-time data is. LangChain has a special prompts library to help parameterize common prompt text. That means the prompts can have placeholders for areas that will be filled in right before submitting the LLM. Instead of doing a very inefficient string replacement on the prompt, you provide LangChain with a map of each placeholder and its value. It will take care of efficiently getting the prompt ready for completion. Learn more about prompts\n\nOnce the model has done its job and responded with the completion, there’s a good chance the application is going to need to do some post-processing before continuing. There might be some simple cleanup of characters or (most likely) the completion needs to be included in a parameter of a class object. LangChain's output parsers make quick work of this by offering a deep integration between how the LLM will respond and the application’s custom classes. Learn more about output parsers\n\nWhen a model is created, it’s trained with some data set. A model is considered small or large based on the amount of data that was used during training. For example, LLMs like GPT have been trained on the entire public internet. That amount of data deserves the “Large” label. The challenge is that no matter how much data a model is trained with it’s still a fixed amount. The data doesn’t stop following after the model is finished.\n\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) is an application design where the application first compares input data to other recent data to gain a better context. Then that up-to-date context is provided to the LLM to provide an up-to-date response. But it’s not as simple as a quick query and continuing to interact with the LLM. There are a few intermediate steps that have to happen. Also, data has to be stored in an understood format so that retrieval of that data is simple and consistent.\n\nLangChain offers a few libraries to aid in implementing the RAG pattern in an application. First, to gain the right context, data might need to come from different sources. Each source likely follows a different schema. LangChain offers the “document” object as a way to “normalize” data coming from multiple different sources. As a document, data can easily be passed between different chains in a very structured way.\n\nThe store that is used to look up up-to-date context is not your typical relational database. It’s a special version of the database that offers to store and retrieve vectors. Most modern databases like AstraDB offer a vector option. There are also vector-specific databases that are built for only the purpose of storing vector embeddings. LangChain offers integrations for all of the popular vector stores, including AstraDB. It also takes things quite a bit further by offering some very convenient features specific to vector search, like Similarity search and Similarity search by vector. You can tune your vector searches with Maximum marginal relevance search. This comes in quite handy when you want to get that context just right - not too much data and not too little data provided to the LLM.\n\nThese days chatbots are all the rage. It’s the “hello world” of AI application development. Thinking about the “chat” concept, when you are chatting with a friend, the conversation has a certain flow to it. As it progresses you both share the history of what has already been said. This helps move the conversation forward.\n\nWhen an AI Application is chatting with an LLM, it needs to give the LLM some historical information (context) about what is being asked. If no context is given the conversation is going to be quite dry and not very productive. In the previous data retrieval section the RAG pattern was described as a way to add this context.\n\nSometimes, though, the context needs to be in the moment. When you are chatting with your friend chances are you are not taking notes, trying to remember every word that was said. The conversation becomes a lecture if you were to do this - which is not that much fun. The same goes for a chat with the LLM.\n\nLangChain offers a special memory library where the application can save a chat’s history to a fast lookup store. The data is stored in a specific way, in a type of store that can offer very quick lookups. Typically is not a relational database. It’s usually a NoSQL or in-memory store.\n\nHaving the ability to quickly retrieve a chat’s history and inject it into the LLM’s prompt is a powerful way of creating very intelligent contextual applications.\n\nHow Does LangChain Work?\n\nWhen you pay with a credit card for something, certain steps need to happen in a specific order. First, the card information needs to be gathered and secured. Then it needs to be transmitted to a processor. The processor makes sure the card account is valid and that the funds are available. The processor transfers the funds from your account to the merchant’s account. Finally, a confirmation of all this is transmitted back and you are given a receipt. Each of those steps must be followed in a specific order. You can’t withdraw the funds from an account with no money in it. The same goes for interacting with an LLM. You can’t send a prompt to the LLM with no context. You’re just doing an internet search at that point.\n\nThe “chain” in LangChain brings the idea of putting AI actions together in order, to create a processing pipeline. Each action, or chain, is a needed step in the pipeline to complete the overall goal. Thinking about the RAG pattern, it starts with the user submitting a question. An embedding is created from that text, a lookup is done on a vector database to gain more context about the question, then a prompt is created using both the original question and the context from the retrieval. The prompt is submitted to the LLM, which responds with an intelligent completion of the prompt.\n\nAll the steps in the RAG pattern need to happen in succession. If anything errors along the way, the processing should stop. LangChain offers the “chain” construct to attach steps together in a specific way with a specific configuration. All LangChain libraries follow this chain construct to make it very easy to move steps around and create powerful processing pipelines.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Using LangChain?\n\nUsing LangChain offers several benefits in the realm of natural language processing.\n\nEnhanced Language Understanding and Generation\n\nLangChain's integration of various language models and tools allows for more sophisticated language processing. This leads to better understanding and generation of human-like language, especially in complex tasks.\n\nCustomization and Flexibility\n\nThe modular structure of LangChain offers significant customization options. This adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, allowing users to tailor language processing solutions to specific needs.\n\nStreamlined Development Process\n\nLangChain's framework simplifies the development of language processing systems. By chaining different components together, it reduces complexity and accelerates the creation of advanced applications.\n\nImproved Efficiency and Accuracy\n\nThe use of LangChain in language tasks enhances both efficiency and accuracy. The framework's ability to combine multiple language processing components leads to quicker and more accurate outcomes.\n\nVersatility Across Sectors\n\nLangChain's adaptability makes it valuable across various sectors, including content creation, customer service, and data analytics. Its ability to handle diverse language tasks makes it a versatile tool in the AI toolkit.\n\nExamples of LangChain Applications\n\nLangChain provides a lot of power by providing a framework that can be used to build generative AI applications. There are a number of different types of genAI applications where LangChain has been purpose built to facilitate.\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\nLangChain offers a few different scenarios that implement the RAG pattern. There is a simple question/answer example that is a classic use of adding context to a prompt. There is also the RAG over code example that aids developers while writing code. The Chat History example creates a very intelligent chat experience with the LLM. Visit LangChain’s use cases area for more.\n\nChatbots are the cornerstone of LLM interactions. LangChain offers a getting-started example, to help you create an AI Application in just a few minutes.\n\nBuild Production Gen AI Chat with Vertex.ai, LangChain and Astra DB Vector Search\n\nLearn how to build an enterprise customer service chatbot that uses Vertex.ai embedding and RAG with LangChain and Astra DB vector search in this free webinar.\n\nSynthetic Data Generation\n\nWhile developing applications, an engineer writes tests to ensure all their functions are working as expected. These are referred to as unit tests. There are also load tests a developer does to ensure the application can handle the load it will see in production. To run either of these tests you need data. Sometimes lots of data. LangChain’s Synthetic data generation example uses an LLM to artificially generate data. A developer could then use that data to test their application.\n\nInteracting with a Database Using Natural Language\n\nWriting SQL queries is not as much fun as it sounds. As one writes a query, they are taking a real-world question and transforming it into SQL syntax. A simple question like “How many chunks can a woodchuck chuck” would be transformed into “select count(chunk) from chunks where animal like ‘woodchuck’”. LangChain’s SQL example uses an LLM to transform a natural language question into a SQL dialect.\n\nGetting Started with LangChain\n\nWhether you have an existing Python app that needs to be taught new AI tricks or you’re starting from scratch, you’ll want to add the LangChain library to the requirements.\n\nUnknown block type \""blockCode\"", please specify a serializer for it in the `serializers.types` prop\n\nAssuming that you plan to interact with an LLM, the next step would be to install its supporting library. View the full list of LLMs here.\n\nUnknown block type \""blockCode\"", please specify a serializer for it in the `serializers.types` prop\n\nWith that, the fun begins! You could create a PromptTemplate + LLM + OutputParser or you could create a simple Prompt template application.

It allows LLM models to create replies based on the most up-to-date data accessible online and simplifies the process of arranging vast volumes of data so that LLMs can quickly access it.\n\nThis is how LangChain enables developers to build dynamic, data-responsive applications. The open-source framework has so far enabled developers to create some pretty advanced AI chatbots, generative question-answering (GQA) systems, and language summarization tools (\n\nyou can find some examples here).\n\nIn this article, we dive into LangChain in detail to show you how it works, what developers can build with it, and more.\n\nLangChain is an open-source framework that gives developers the tools they need to create applications using large language models (LLMs). In its essence, LangChain is a prompt orchestration tool that makes it easier for teams to connect various prompts interactively.\n\nLangChain began as an open source project, but as the GitHub stars piled up, it was quickly turned into a company led by Harrison Chase.\n\nLLMs (such as GPT3 or GPT4) give a completion for a single prompt, which is more or less like receiving a complete result for a single request. For example, you could tell the LLM to “create a sculpture,” and it would do it. You may also provide more sophisticated requests, such as “create a sculpture of an axolotl at the bottom of a lake.” The LLM will likely return what you wanted. \n\nBut what if you asked this instead:\n\n“Give me the step by step instructions to carving an axolotl sculpture out of wood”? \n\nTo avoid having the user explicitly provide every single step and choose the sequence of execution, you can use LLMs to produce the next step at each point, utilizing the prior step results as its context.\n\nThe LangChain framework can do that for you. It arranges a succession of prompts to reach a desired result. It provides a simple interface for developers to interact with LLMs. That way, you could say that LangChain works like a reductionist wrapper for leveraging LLMs.\n\nWhat is LangChain Expression Language?\n\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a declarative language that helps engineers connect chains easily. It was built from the start to facilitate placing prototypes in production with no code modifications.\n\nHere are a few benefits of LCEL:\n\nWhen you use LCEL to create your chains, you get the best potential time-to-first-token (the amount of time it takes for the first piece of output to appear). For some chains, this means that we stream tokens directly from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same pace as the LLM provider.\n\nAny chain generated with LCEL may be called using both the synchronous API (for example, in a Jupyter notebook when experimenting) and the asynchronous API (like a LangServe server). This allows for the use of the same code for prototypes and production, with excellent speed and the flexibility to handle several concurrent requests on the same server.\n\nA data scientist or practitioner can have steps in LCEL chains executed in parallel.\n\nLangServe can quickly deploy any chain generated using LCEL.\n\nWhy consider using LangChain?\n\nWhen employed with a single prompt, LLMs are already quite strong. However, what they do is essentially perform completions by predicting the most likely next word. They don’t think and reason like people do before they say something or respond. At least that’s what we like to believe.\n\nReasoning is the process of using information acquired prior to the communication act in order to reach new conclusions. We don’t consider creating an axolotl sculpture as a single continuous operation but rather as a succession of smaller actions that impact the next steps.\n\nLangChain is a framework that allows developers to create agents capable of reasoning about issues and breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks. By building intermediary stages and chaining complex commands together, you can add context and memory to completions using LangChain.\n\nHere’s an example of LangChain usage with Large Language Models\n\nIf you ask an LLM which branches were top performers in your chain of art supply stores, here’s what’s going to happen:\n\nThe model will build a logical SQL query to retrieve the results and serve you a bunch of fictitious but entirely plausible column names.\n\nWhat would that look like if you used LangChain?\n\nIn this scenario, you could provide the LLM with a bunch of functions to use and then ask it to create a process for you. Then, after going through that process, you might get a single answer: \n\n“Art supply store #1516 in Dallas is your top-performing store.“\n\nNote that some work needs to go into the formulation of the SQL query.\n\nYou can start by writing some functions like getTables() or getSchema(table). But how do you get the table schema if you don’t know the table names? Which of the table schemas includes data about sales per store anyway? \n\nUsing LangChain, developers can rely on LLMs to produce each step and ask each of these questions. So, you no longer need to spend time providing input and manually organizing these phases.\n\nWhy is LangChain captivating the industry?\n\nLangChain is fascinating because it lets teams augment existing LLMs with memory and context. They can artificially add “reasoning” and complete more complex tasks with greater precision and accuracy.\n\nDevelopers are excited about LangChain because it offers a new approach to creating user interfaces – where users can just ask for what they want rather than dragging and dropping elements or using code.\n\nConsider a tool we’ve all used at some point: Microsoft PowerPoint. Take a look at the sheer number of buttons, each of which performs a specific job. Nobody would mind using natural language to describe exactly what they need and get a neat presentation style in a matter of seconds.\n\nThis explains the massive success of ChatGPT. It’s way more than a basic implementation of GPT. Its output comes from constant learning via a feedback loop. When a coding request is made, ChatGPT formalizes the request, presents two implementations, gives the reasoning for each, and explains the code.\n\nGiven that there is no method to describe the code before it was created by the LLM, the LLM completion to explain the code must have come to life after it was formed.\n\nLangChain was developed in Python and JavaScript, and it supports a wide range of language models such as GPT3, Hugging Face, Jurassic-1 Jumbo, and others.\n\nTo start using LangChain, you must first create a language model. This means either taking advantage of a publicly available language model, such as GPT3, or training your own model.\n\nOnce completed, you can start developing applications with LangChain. LangChain offers a number of tools and APIs that make it simple to link language models to external data sources, interact with their surroundings, and develop complicated applications.\n\nIt creates a workflow by chaining together a sequence of components called links. Each link in the chain does something specific, such as:\n\nFormatting of user input\n\nReferring to a linguistic model\n\nProcessing the language model’s output\n\nThe links in a chain are connected in a sequential manner, with the output of one link serving as the input to the next. By chaining together small operations, the chain is able to do more complicated tasks.\n\nWhat are the fundamental components of LangChain?\n\nNaturally, LangChain calls for LLMs – large language models that are trained on vast text and code datasets. You can use them to generate text, translate languages, and answer queries, among other things.\n\nSource: LangChain documentation\n\nPrompt templates are used to format user input so that the language model can understand it. You can use them to provide context for the user’s input or to describe the job that the language model should complete. A prompt template for a chatbot, for example, can include the user’s name and question.\n\nIndexes are databases that hold information about the training data for the LLM. This data can comprise the text of the documents, their metadata, and their connections. \n\nRetrievers are algorithms that look for specific information in an index. You can use them to locate documents that are relevant to a user’s query or documents that are most similar to a particular file. Retrievers are critical for increasing the LLM’s response speed and accuracy.\n\nLLM output parsers are in charge of formatting the replies they generate. They can adjust the structure of the response, eliminate undesired stuff, or add extra information. Output parsers are key to ensuring that the LLM’s replies are simple to interpret and apply.\n\nSource: LangChain documentation\n\nA vector store houses mathematical representations of words and phrases. It comes in handy for tasks like answering questions and summarizing. A\n\nvector database, for example, can be used to locate all words that are comparable to the word “cat.”\n\nAgents are programs that can reason about issues and divide them into smaller subtasks. You can use an agent to direct the flow of a chain and decide which jobs to do – for example, assess whether a language model or a human expert is best suited to answer a user’s inquiry.\n\n8 benefits of using LangChain\n\nScalability – LangChain may be used to create applications capable of handling massive volumes of data.\n\nAdaptability – The framework’s adaptability allows it to be used to develop a wide range of applications, from chatbots to question-answering systems.\n\nExtensibility – Developers may add their own features and functionality to the framework because it is expandable.\n\nEase of use – LangChain offers a high-level API for connecting language models to various data sources and building complicated applications.\n\nOpen source – LangChain is an open-source framework that is free to use and modify.\n\nVibrant community – There is a huge and active community of LangChain users and developers that can assist and support you.\n\nGreat documentation – The documentation is thorough and simple to understand.\n\nIntegrations – LangChain may be integrated with various frameworks and libraries, such as Flask and TensorFlow.\n\nHow to get started with LangChain\n\nLangChain’s source code is accessible on\n\nGitHub. You can download and install the source code on your machine. \n\nLangChain is also available as a Docker image, making it simple to install on cloud platforms.\n\nYou can also install it with a simple pip command in Python: langchain install pip\n\nIf you want to install all of LangChain’s integration requirements, use the following command: pip install langchain[all]\n\nNow you’re ready to start a new project!\n\nCreate a new directory and run the following command: init langchain\n\nNext, you need to import the required modules and make a chain, which is a series of links where each performs a certain function. \n\nTo make a chain, create an instance of the Chain class and then add links to it. Here’s a snippet that generates a chain that calls a language model and receives its response: Chain() returns a chain.add_link(Link(model=”openai”, prompt=”Create an axolotl sculpture”)\n\nTo execute a chain, use the run() function on the chain object. \n\nThe output of a chain is the output of the chain’s last link. To get the chain’s output, use the get_output() function on the chain object.\n\nFinally, you can personalize the chain by changing the properties of links or adding/removing them.\n\nWhat kind of apps can you build with LangChain?\n\nContent generation and summarization\n\nLangChain comes in handy for creating summarizing systems capable of producing summaries of news articles, blog entries, and other sorts of text. Another common use case is content generators that generate writing that is both helpful and interesting.\n\nNaturally, chatbots or any other system that responds to questions is a great use case for LangChain. Such systems will be able to access and process data from a range of sources, such as databases, APIs, and the internet. Chatbots can respond to queries, provide customer support, or even generate unique text formats such as poetry, code, screenplays, musical pieces, email, letters, and so on.\n\nData analysis software\n\nLangChain can also be used to create data analysis tools that assist users in understanding the links between various data pieces.\n\nIs LangChain open-source?\n\nYes, LangChain is an open-source project that is entirely free to use. You can get the source code from\n\nGitHub and use it to create your own apps. Also, you can use\n\npre-trained models provided by LangChain.\n\nWrap up: the future of LangChain\n\nThe primary use case for LangChain at the moment is chat-based apps on top of LLMs (particularly ChatGPT), also called “chat interfaces.” In\n\na recent interview, the company’s CEO Harrison Chase, said the ideal use case right now is a “chat over your documents.” LangChain also provides additional features to improve the conversation experience for applications, such as streaming, which implies providing the output of the LLM token by token rather than all at once.\n\nHe also hinted at the future evolution of such interfaces:\n\n“Long term, there’s probably better UX’s than chat. But I think at the moment that’s the immediate thing that you can stand up super-easily, without a lot of extra work. In six months, do I expect chat to be the best UX? Probably not. But I think right now, what’s the thing that you can build at the moment to deliver value, it’s probably that [i.e. chat].”\n\nIn the future, we might see teams developing applications powered by LangChain for other areas. Given the novelty of designing apps with LLMs, frameworks like LangChain are indispensable for providing tools to help address some of the challenges with LLMs in the data science world. Install LangChain and see what it can do for yourself.\n\nIdan Novogroder Author\n\nIdan has an extensive background in software and DevOps engineering.

It allows LLM models to create replies based on the most up-to-date data accessible online and simplifies the process of arranging vast volumes of data so that LLMs can quickly access it.\n\nThis is how LangChain enables developers to build dynamic, data-responsive applications. The open-source framework has so far enabled developers to create some pretty advanced AI chatbots, generative question-answering (GQA) systems, and language summarization tools (\n\nyou can find some examples here).\n\nIn this article, we dive into LangChain in detail to show you how it works, what developers can build with it, and more.\n\nLangChain is an open-source framework that gives developers the tools they need to create applications using large language models (LLMs). In its essence, LangChain is a prompt orchestration tool that makes it easier for teams to connect various prompts interactively.\n\nLangChain began as an open source project, but as the GitHub stars piled up, it was quickly turned into a company led by Harrison Chase.\n\nLLMs (such as GPT3 or GPT4) give a completion for a single prompt, which is more or less like receiving a complete result for a single request. For example, you could tell the LLM to “create a sculpture,” and it would do it. You may also provide more sophisticated requests, such as “create a sculpture of an axolotl at the bottom of a lake.” The LLM will likely return what you wanted. \n\nBut what if you asked this instead:\n\n“Give me the step by step instructions to carving an axolotl sculpture out of wood”? \n\nTo avoid having the user explicitly provide every single step and choose the sequence of execution, you can use LLMs to produce the next step at each point, utilizing the prior step results as its context.\n\nThe LangChain framework can do that for you. It arranges a succession of prompts to reach a desired result. It provides a simple interface for developers to interact with LLMs. That way, you could say that LangChain works like a reductionist wrapper for leveraging LLMs.\n\nWhat is LangChain Expression Language?\n\nLangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a declarative language that helps engineers connect chains easily. It was built from the start to facilitate placing prototypes in production with no code modifications.\n\nHere are a few benefits of LCEL:\n\nWhen you use LCEL to create your chains, you get the best potential time-to-first-token (the amount of time it takes for the first piece of output to appear). For some chains, this means that we stream tokens directly from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same pace as the LLM provider.\n\nAny chain generated with LCEL may be called using both the synchronous API (for example, in a Jupyter notebook when experimenting) and the asynchronous API (like a LangServe server). This allows for the use of the same code for prototypes and production, with excellent speed and the flexibility to handle several concurrent requests on the same server.\n\nA data scientist or practitioner can have steps in LCEL chains executed in parallel.\n\nLangServe can quickly deploy any chain generated using LCEL.\n\nWhy consider using LangChain?\n\nWhen employed with a single prompt, LLMs are already quite strong. However, what they do is essentially perform completions by predicting the most likely next word. They don’t think and reason like people do before they say something or respond. At least that’s what we like to believe.\n\nReasoning is the process of using information acquired prior to the communication act in order to reach new conclusions. We don’t consider creating an axolotl sculpture as a single continuous operation but rather as a succession of smaller actions that impact the next steps.\n\nLangChain is a framework that allows developers to create agents capable of reasoning about issues and breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks. By building intermediary stages and chaining complex commands together, you can add context and memory to completions using LangChain.\n\nHere’s an example of LangChain usage with Large Language Models\n\nIf you ask an LLM which branches were top performers in your chain of art supply stores, here’s what’s going to happen:\n\nThe model will build a logical SQL query to retrieve the results and serve you a bunch of fictitious but entirely plausible column names.\n\nWhat would that look like if you used LangChain?\n\nIn this scenario, you could provide the LLM with a bunch of functions to use and then ask it to create a process for you. Then, after going through that process, you might get a single answer: \n\n“Art supply store #1516 in Dallas is your top-performing store.“\n\nNote that some work needs to go into the formulation of the SQL query.\n\nYou can start by writing some functions like getTables() or getSchema(table). But how do you get the table schema if you don’t know the table names? Which of the table schemas includes data about sales per store anyway? \n\nUsing LangChain, developers can rely on LLMs to produce each step and ask each of these questions. So, you no longer need to spend time providing input and manually organizing these phases.\n\nWhy is LangChain captivating the industry?\n\nLangChain is fascinating because it lets teams augment existing LLMs with memory and context. They can artificially add “reasoning” and complete more complex tasks with greater precision and accuracy.\n\nDevelopers are excited about LangChain because it offers a new approach to creating user interfaces – where users can just ask for what they want rather than dragging and dropping elements or using code.\n\nConsider a tool we’ve all used at some point: Microsoft PowerPoint. Take a look at the sheer number of buttons, each of which performs a specific job. Nobody would mind using natural language to describe exactly what they need and get a neat presentation style in a matter of seconds.\n\nThis explains the massive success of ChatGPT. It’s way more than a basic implementation of GPT. Its output comes from constant learning via a feedback loop. When a coding request is made, ChatGPT formalizes the request, presents two implementations, gives the reasoning for each, and explains the code.\n\nGiven that there is no method to describe the code before it was created by the LLM, the LLM completion to explain the code must have come to life after it was formed.\n\nLangChain was developed in Python and JavaScript, and it supports a wide range of language models such as GPT3, Hugging Face, Jurassic-1 Jumbo, and others.\n\nTo start using LangChain, you must first create a language model. This means either taking advantage of a publicly available language model, such as GPT3, or training your own model.\n\nOnce completed, you can start developing applications with LangChain. LangChain offers a number of tools and APIs that make it simple to link language models to external data sources, interact with their surroundings, and develop complicated applications.\n\nIt creates a workflow by chaining together a sequence of components called links. Each link in the chain does something specific, such as:\n\nFormatting of user input\n\nReferring to a linguistic model\n\nProcessing the language model’s output\n\nThe links in a chain are connected in a sequential manner, with the output of one link serving as the input to the next. By chaining together small operations, the chain is able to do more complicated tasks.\n\nWhat are the fundamental components of LangChain?\n\nNaturally, LangChain calls for LLMs – large language models that are trained on vast text and code datasets. You can use them to generate text, translate languages, and answer queries, among other things.\n\nSource: LangChain documentation\n\nPrompt templates are used to format user input so that the language model can understand it. You can use them to provide context for the user’s input or to describe the job that the language model should complete. A prompt template for a chatbot, for example, can include the user’s name and question.\n\nIndexes are databases that hold information about the training data for the LLM. This data can comprise the text of the documents, their metadata, and their connections. \n\nRetrievers are algorithms that look for specific information in an index. You can use them to locate documents that are relevant to a user’s query or documents that are most similar to a particular file. Retrievers are critical for increasing the LLM’s response speed and accuracy.\n\nLLM output parsers are in charge of formatting the replies they generate. They can adjust the structure of the response, eliminate undesired stuff, or add extra information. Output parsers are key to ensuring that the LLM’s replies are simple to interpret and apply.\n\nSource: LangChain documentation\n\nA vector store houses mathematical representations of words and phrases. It comes in handy for tasks like answering questions and summarizing. A\n\nvector database, for example, can be used to locate all words that are comparable to the word “cat.”\n\nAgents are programs that can reason about issues and divide them into smaller subtasks. You can use an agent to direct the flow of a chain and decide which jobs to do – for example, assess whether a language model or a human expert is best suited to answer a user’s inquiry.\n\n8 benefits of using LangChain\n\nScalability – LangChain may be used to create applications capable of handling massive volumes of data.\n\nAdaptability – The framework’s adaptability allows it to be used to develop a wide range of applications, from chatbots to question-answering systems.\n\nExtensibility – Developers may add their own features and functionality to the framework because it is expandable.\n\nEase of use – LangChain offers a high-level API for connecting language models to various data sources and building complicated applications.\n\nOpen source – LangChain is an open-source framework that is free to use and modify.\n\nVibrant community – There is a huge and active community of LangChain users and developers that can assist and support you.\n\nGreat documentation – The documentation is thorough and simple to understand.\n\nIntegrations – LangChain may be integrated with various frameworks and libraries, such as Flask and TensorFlow.\n\nHow to get started with LangChain\n\nLangChain’s source code is accessible on\n\nGitHub. You can download and install the source code on your machine. \n\nLangChain is also available as a Docker image, making it simple to install on cloud platforms.\n\nYou can also install it with a simple pip command in Python: langchain install pip\n\nIf you want to install all of LangChain’s integration requirements, use the following command: pip install langchain[all]\n\nNow you’re ready to start a new project!\n\nCreate a new directory and run the following command: init langchain\n\nNext, you need to import the required modules and make a chain, which is a series of links where each performs a certain function. \n\nTo make a chain, create an instance of the Chain class and then add links to it. Here’s a snippet that generates a chain that calls a language model and receives its response: Chain() returns a chain.add_link(Link(model=”openai”, prompt=”Create an axolotl sculpture”)\n\nTo execute a chain, use the run() function on the chain object. \n\nThe output of a chain is the output of the chain’s last link. To get the chain’s output, use the get_output() function on the chain object.\n\nFinally, you can personalize the chain by changing the properties of links or adding/removing them.\n\nWhat kind of apps can you build with LangChain?\n\nContent generation and summarization\n\nLangChain comes in handy for creating summarizing systems capable of producing summaries of news articles, blog entries, and other sorts of text. Another common use case is content generators that generate writing that is both helpful and interesting.\n\nNaturally, chatbots or any other system that responds to questions is a great use case for LangChain. Such systems will be able to access and process data from a range of sources, such as databases, APIs, and the internet. Chatbots can respond to queries, provide customer support, or even generate unique text formats such as poetry, code, screenplays, musical pieces, email, letters, and so on.\n\nData analysis software\n\nLangChain can also be used to create data analysis tools that assist users in understanding the links between various data pieces.\n\nIs LangChain open-source?\n\nYes, LangChain is an open-source project that is entirely free to use. You can get the source code from\n\nGitHub and use it to create your own apps. Also, you can use\n\npre-trained models provided by LangChain.\n\nWrap up: the future of LangChain\n\nThe primary use case for LangChain at the moment is chat-based apps on top of LLMs (particularly ChatGPT), also called “chat interfaces.” In\n\na recent interview, the company’s CEO Harrison Chase, said the ideal use case right now is a “chat over your documents.” LangChain also provides additional features to improve the conversation experience for applications, such as streaming, which implies providing the output of the LLM token by token rather than all at once.\n\nHe also hinted at the future evolution of such interfaces:\n\n“Long term, there’s probably better UX’s than chat. But I think at the moment that’s the immediate thing that you can stand up super-easily, without a lot of extra work. In six months, do I expect chat to be the best UX? Probably not. But I think right now, what’s the thing that you can build at the moment to deliver value, it’s probably that [i.e. chat].”\n\nIn the future, we might see teams developing applications powered by LangChain for other areas. Given the novelty of designing apps with LLMs, frameworks like LangChain are indispensable for providing tools to help address some of the challenges with LLMs in the data science world. Install LangChain and see what it can do for yourself.\n\nIdan Novogroder Author\n\nIdan has an extensive background in software and DevOps engineering.

Why Use LangChain?\n\nPaul Yang - March 31st, 2023\n\nOne sentence answer: It's an open-source library that equips developers with the necessary tools to create applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\nLangChain is an open-source library that provides developers with the tools to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). More specifically, LangChain is an orchestration tool for prompts, making it easier for developers to chain different prompts interactively.\n\nLLMs (like GPT3) provide a completion for a single prompt – you can think of it as getting a complete result for a single request. For example, you could say \""bake me a cake,\"" and the LLM would produce a cake. You can also give more complex commands like \""bake me a vanilla cake with chocolate frosting,\"" and the LLM would also likely return said cake.\n\nBut instead, what if you asked: “give me the ingredients you need to bake a cake and the steps to bake a cake”? (This does not happen with LLMs, but does happen with ChatGPT).\n\nTo avoid having the user manually give each step and determine the order of execution, we can use LLMs to generate the next step at each point, using the outputs of the previous steps as context.\n\nIn short, LangChain is a framework that can orchestrate a series of prompts to achieve a desired outcome. It offers an easy-to-use way for developers to work with LLMs. In reductionist terms, LangChain is a wrapper for using LLMs.\n\nLLMs are already incredibly powerful when used with a single prompt, but they execute completions by guessing the most likely next word, rather than reasoning as humans do.\n\nReasoning, definitionally, is using existing knowledge to form new conclusions. We never consider “baking a cake” to be a single contiguous task, but a collection of smaller tasks that influence the subsequent.\n\nLangChain is a framework that enables developers to build agents that can reason about problems and break them into smaller sub-tasks. With LangChain, we can introduce context and memory into completions by creating intermediate steps and chaining commands together\n\nIf I ask a LLM to tell me which stores were top-performing last week, it will generate a reasonable SQL query to pull my result, likely with fake, but real-looking column names.\n\nBut as a developer in LangChain, we can offer the LLM a choice of functions to use, and ask it to compose a workflow. Then, can actually go through the process and get back a single answer: “store #1317 in New York is top performing.”\n\nWhat do I need for a SQL query to get the top-performing store?\n\nYou can create a set of functions including getTables(), getSchema(table) etc…\n\nI have some table names, how do I get table schema?\n\nHere are a bunch of tableSchemas, which one contains sales by store?\n\nHow do I query sales by store to get top-performing stores given a table with this schema?\n\nThese are the top rows, which store was best performing last week?\n\nThe extraordinarily cool part is that we rely on LLMs to generate each step/question and so there is no longer a need for human input to order these steps manually.\n\nWhat’s So Exciting About LangChain?\n\nAt a high level, LangChain is exciting because it allows us to enhance already powerful LLMs with memory and context. We can introduce “reasoning” artificially and can solve more complex tasks with more accuracy.\n\nLangChain is particularly exciting to developers because it provides a new way to build user interfaces. Instead of dragging and dropping or using code, users can simply ask for what they want.\n\nFor example, Microsoft Word has thousands of buttons, each mapping to some function. With frameworks like LangChain, we can combine the context of the words on the page, available functions, and our request to accomplish what we actually want to do. As a user, I never “want” to change the page number font size; I frequently have to, because buttons in Word represent atomic actions and the button to add page numbers adds it in Calibri 11pt. LangChain allows us to achieve goals directly, instead of performing atomic actions.\n\nChatGPT's success lies in the fact that it is not simply a naive implementation of GPT. Its answers are a product of feeding results back into itself several times. When a coding request is made, ChatGPT restates the request more formally, offers two implementations, describes the motivation for each, and explains the resulting code.\n\nThere is no way to explain the code before it was generated by the LLM; therefore the LLM completion to explain the code must have happened after.\n\nHow Are We Using LangChain?\n\nLangChain can be particularly useful in the complex field of data science. Here are some reasons why data science is well-suited for LLM-augmented workflows:\n\nThere is a heavy reliance on different libraries, which can make remembering syntax challenging.\n\nThe focus is for the data scientist to make inferences about outputs, not on the code itself.\n\nThere is a broad audience of stakeholders who need insights but may not have the skills to self-serve.\n\nNot only does it save time, but it also allows proficient data developers to think at a higher level and not be in the weeds. It’s like having a junior data scientist at all times to produce code and report the outputs to you.\n\nAs an example, let’s say that we ran some marketing campaign, and what we want to know is the 3 most important drivers of some outcome.\n\nA LLM does a great job making boilerplate code, so we could take this, edit it with some coding knowledge, and get a pretty good result by the end.\n\nimport snowflake.connector import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from xgboost import XGBClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV import shap # Connect to Snowflake conn = snowflake.connector.connect( user='<USERNAME>', password='<PASSWORD>', account='<ACCOUNT>', warehouse='<WAREHOUSE>', database='<DATABASE>', schema='<SCHEMA>' ) # Pull data from Snowflake table into pandas dataframe query = 'SELECT * FROM <TABLE>' df = pd.read_sql(query, conn) # Split into train/test sets X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1) y = df['target_column'] X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Define XGBoost model and parameters for RandomizedSearchCV xgb_model = XGBClassifier() parameters = { 'max_depth': range(3, 10), 'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2], 'n_estimators': range(50, 200, 25), 'gamma': [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], 'colsample_bytree': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9], 'subsample': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9] } # Train XGBoost model using RandomizedSearchCV xgb_random = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=xgb_model, param_distributions=parameters, n_iter=50, cv=5, verbose=0, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1) xgb_random.fit(X_train, y_train) # Get SHAP values explainer = shap.Explainer(xgb_random.best_estimator_, X_train) shap_values = explainer(X_test) # Print top 3 most important features shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type=\""bar\"", max_display=3)\n\nHowever, there is some syntactical wrangling, both to fit the functions to our dataset and a strong pre-requisite of data science knowledge to be successful. For instance, if there are text columns, I might have to ask the LLM for encoding, since it does not have context about my dataset.\n\nIn Einblick however, in addition to raw Python, we have many functions and widgets. This means we can mix-and-match SQL and Python with pre-configured data connectors, helper functions for getting table schema, and advanced tools like AutoML.\n\nSo rather than wasting time editing a long block of completion code, we can rely on pre-existing components to end up with user-friendly outputs.\n\nComplex questions will require human experts still. But most data questions are not deep learning models. Frequently, the questions being asked are straightforward factual requests that just happen to require intermediate knowledge, mixing SQL/Python.\n\nFor example, a marketing director or product manager may need to know how many users logged in two weeks/months in a row. Most analytics tools cannot answer, and it does not make sense to dashboard every single possible metric.\n\nIn summary, LangChain is an exciting development for developers who want to build applications powered by LLMs. It provides a new way to build UIs. Particularly for us, it simplifies the complexity of data science, making it easier for more people to access the power of data. By using LangChain as an orchestration tool, developers can take advantage of the power of LLMs to build the next generation of software.\n\nEinblick Prompt: Powered by LangChain\n\nEinblick Prompt leverages OpenAI and LangChain to bring the simplicity of ChatGPT to our AI-native data notebooks.

It’s like having a junior data scientist at all times to produce code and report the outputs to you.\n\nAs an example, let’s say that we ran some marketing campaign, and what we want to know is the 3 most important drivers of some outcome.\n\nA LLM does a great job making boilerplate code, so we could take this, edit it with some coding knowledge, and get a pretty good result by the end.\n\nimport snowflake.connector import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from xgboost import XGBClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV import shap # Connect to Snowflake conn = snowflake.connector.connect( user='<USERNAME>', password='<PASSWORD>', account='<ACCOUNT>', warehouse='<WAREHOUSE>', database='<DATABASE>', schema='<SCHEMA>' ) # Pull data from Snowflake table into pandas dataframe query = 'SELECT * FROM <TABLE>' df = pd.read_sql(query, conn) # Split into train/test sets X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1) y = df['target_column'] X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Define XGBoost model and parameters for RandomizedSearchCV xgb_model = XGBClassifier() parameters = { 'max_depth': range(3, 10), 'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2], 'n_estimators': range(50, 200, 25), 'gamma': [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], 'colsample_bytree': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9], 'subsample': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9] } # Train XGBoost model using RandomizedSearchCV xgb_random = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=xgb_model, param_distributions=parameters, n_iter=50, cv=5, verbose=0, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1) xgb_random.fit(X_train, y_train) # Get SHAP values explainer = shap.Explainer(xgb_random.best_estimator_, X_train) shap_values = explainer(X_test) # Print top 3 most important features shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type=\""bar\"", max_display=3)\n\nHowever, there is some syntactical wrangling, both to fit the functions to our dataset and a strong pre-requisite of data science knowledge to be successful. For instance, if there are text columns, I might have to ask the LLM for encoding, since it does not have context about my dataset.\n\nIn Einblick however, in addition to raw Python, we have many functions and widgets. This means we can mix-and-match SQL and Python with pre-configured data connectors, helper functions for getting table schema, and advanced tools like AutoML.\n\nSo rather than wasting time editing a long block of completion code, we can rely on pre-existing components to end up with user-friendly outputs.\n\nComplex questions will require human experts still. But most data questions are not deep learning models. Frequently, the questions being asked are straightforward factual requests that just happen to require intermediate knowledge, mixing SQL/Python.\n\nFor example, a marketing director or product manager may need to know how many users logged in two weeks/months in a row. Most analytics tools cannot answer, and it does not make sense to dashboard every single possible metric.\n\nIn summary, LangChain is an exciting development for developers who want to build applications powered by LLMs. It provides a new way to build UIs. Particularly for us, it simplifies the complexity of data science, making it easier for more people to access the power of data. By using LangChain as an orchestration tool, developers can take advantage of the power of LLMs to build the next generation of software.\n\nEinblick Prompt: Powered by LangChain\n\nEinblick Prompt leverages OpenAI and LangChain to bring the simplicity of ChatGPT to our AI-native data notebooks.

Since then, they’ve enjoyed a steady growth in popularity.\n\nThat is until late 2022. Interest in LLMs and the broader discipline of generative AI has skyrocketed. The reasons for this are likely the continuous upward momentum of significant advances in LLMs.\n\nWe saw the dramatic news about Google’s “sentient” LaMDA chatbot. The first high-performance and open-source LLM called BLOOM was released. OpenAI released their next-generation text embedding model and the next generation of “GPT-3.5” models.\n\nAfter all these giant leaps forward in the LLM space, OpenAI released ChatGPT — thrusting LLMs into the spotlight.\n\nLangChain appeared around the same time. Its creator, Harrison Chase, made the first commit in late October 2022. Leaving a short couple of months of development before getting caught in the LLM wave.\n\nDespite being early days for the library, it is already packed full of incredible features for building amazing tools around the core of LLMs. In this article, we’ll introduce the library and start with the most straightforward component offered by LangChain — LLMs.\n\nAt its core, LangChain is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more.\n\nThe core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:\n\nPrompt templates: Prompt templates are templates for different types of prompts. Like “chatbot” style templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc\n\nLLMs: Large language models like GPT-3, BLOOM, etc\n\nAgents: Agents use LLMs to decide what actions should be taken. Tools like web search or calculators can be used, and all are packaged into a logical loop of operations.\n\nMemory: Short-term memory, long-term memory.\n\nWe will dive into each of these in much more detail in upcoming chapters of the LangChain handbook.\n\nFor now, we’ll start with the basics behind prompt templates and LLMs. We’ll also explore two LLM options available from the library, using models from Hugging Face Hub or OpenAI.\n\nStart using Pinecone for free\n\nPinecone is the developer-favorite vector database that's fast and easy to use at any scale.\n\nOur First Prompt Templates\n\nPrompts being input to LLMs are often structured in different ways so that we can get different results. For Q&A, we could take a user’s question and reformat it for different Q&A styles, like conventional Q&A, a bullet list of answers, or even a summary of problems relevant to the given question.\n\nCreating Prompts in LangChain\n\nLet’s put together a simple question-answering prompt template. We first need to install the langchain library.\n\n!pip install langchain\n\nFollow along with the code via the walkthrough!\n\nFrom here, we import the PromptTemplate class and initialize a template like so:\n\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate template = \""\""\""Question: {question} Answer: \""\""\"" prompt = PromptTemplate( template=template, input_variables=['question'] ) # user question question = \""Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?\""\n\nWhen using these prompt template with the given question we will get:\n\nQuestion: Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season? Answer:\n\nFor now, that’s all we need. We’ll use the same prompt template across both Hugging Face Hub and OpenAI LLM generations.\n\nHugging Face Hub LLM\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub endpoint in LangChain connects to the Hugging Face Hub and runs the models via their free inference endpoints.

Since then, they’ve enjoyed a steady growth in popularity.\n\nThat is until late 2022. Interest in LLMs and the broader discipline of generative AI has skyrocketed. The reasons for this are likely the continuous upward momentum of significant advances in LLMs.\n\nWe saw the dramatic news about Google’s “sentient” LaMDA chatbot. The first high-performance and open-source LLM called BLOOM was released. OpenAI released their next-generation text embedding model and the next generation of “GPT-3.5” models.\n\nAfter all these giant leaps forward in the LLM space, OpenAI released ChatGPT — thrusting LLMs into the spotlight.\n\nLangChain appeared around the same time. Its creator, Harrison Chase, made the first commit in late October 2022. Leaving a short couple of months of development before getting caught in the LLM wave.\n\nDespite being early days for the library, it is already packed full of incredible features for building amazing tools around the core of LLMs. In this article, we’ll introduce the library and start with the most straightforward component offered by LangChain — LLMs.\n\nAt its core, LangChain is a framework built around LLMs. We can use it for chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA), summarization, and much more.\n\nThe core idea of the library is that we can “chain” together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:\n\nPrompt templates: Prompt templates are templates for different types of prompts. Like “chatbot” style templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc\n\nLLMs: Large language models like GPT-3, BLOOM, etc\n\nAgents: Agents use LLMs to decide what actions should be taken. Tools like web search or calculators can be used, and all are packaged into a logical loop of operations.\n\nMemory: Short-term memory, long-term memory.\n\nWe will dive into each of these in much more detail in upcoming chapters of the LangChain handbook.\n\nFor now, we’ll start with the basics behind prompt templates and LLMs. We’ll also explore two LLM options available from the library, using models from Hugging Face Hub or OpenAI.\n\nStart using Pinecone for free\n\nPinecone is the developer-favorite vector database that's fast and easy to use at any scale.\n\nOur First Prompt Templates\n\nPrompts being input to LLMs are often structured in different ways so that we can get different results. For Q&A, we could take a user’s question and reformat it for different Q&A styles, like conventional Q&A, a bullet list of answers, or even a summary of problems relevant to the given question.\n\nCreating Prompts in LangChain\n\nLet’s put together a simple question-answering prompt template. We first need to install the langchain library.\n\n!pip install langchain\n\nFollow along with the code via the walkthrough!\n\nFrom here, we import the PromptTemplate class and initialize a template like so:\n\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate template = \""\""\""Question: {question} Answer: \""\""\"" prompt = PromptTemplate( template=template, input_variables=['question'] ) # user question question = \""Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?\""\n\nWhen using these prompt template with the given question we will get:\n\nQuestion: Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season? Answer:\n\nFor now, that’s all we need. We’ll use the same prompt template across both Hugging Face Hub and OpenAI LLM generations.\n\nHugging Face Hub LLM\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub endpoint in LangChain connects to the Hugging Face Hub and runs the models via their free inference endpoints. We need a Hugging Face account and API key to use these endpoints.\n\nOnce you have an API key, we add it to the HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN environment variable. We can do this with Python like so:\n\nimport os os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN'] = 'HF_API_KEY'\n\nNext, we must install the huggingface_hub library via Pip.\n\n!pip install huggingface_hub\n\nNow we can generate text using a Hub model. We’ll use google/flan-t5-x1.\n\nThe default Hugging Face Hub inference APIs do not use specialized hardware and, therefore, can be slow. They are also not suitable for running larger models like bigscience/bloom-560m or google/flan-t5-xxl (note xxl vs. xl).\n\nfrom langchain import HuggingFaceHub, LLMChain # initialize Hub LLM hub_llm = HuggingFaceHub( repo_id='google/flan-t5-xl', model_kwargs={'temperature':1e-10} ) # create prompt template > LLM chain llm_chain = LLMChain( prompt=prompt, llm=hub_llm ) # ask the user question about NFL 2010 print(llm_chain.run(question))\n\nFor this question, we get the correct answer of \""green bay packers\"".\n\nAsking Multiple Questions\n\nIf we’d like to ask multiple questions, we can try two approaches:\n\nIterate through all questions using the generate method, answering them one at a time.\n\nPlace all questions into a single prompt for the LLM; this will only work for more advanced LLMs.\n\nStarting with option (1), let’s see how to use the generate method:\n\nqs = [ {'question': \""Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?\""}, {'question': \""If I am 6 ft 4 inches, how tall am I in centimeters?\""}, {'question': \""Who was the 12th person on the moon?\""}, {'question': \""How many eyes does a blade of grass have?\""} ] res = llm_chain.generate(qs) res\n\nLLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='green bay packers', generation_info=None)], [Generation(text='184', generation_info=None)], [Generation(text='john glenn', generation_info=None)], [Generation(text='one', generation_info=None)]], llm_output=None)\n\nHere we get bad results except for the first question. This is simply a limitation of the LLM being used.\n\nIf the model cannot answer individual questions accurately, grouping all queries into a single prompt is unlikely to work. However, for the sake of experimentation, let’s try it.\n\nmulti_template = \""\""\""Answer the following questions one at a time. Questions: {questions} Answers: \""\""\"" long_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=multi_template, input_variables=[\""questions\""]) llm_chain = LLMChain( prompt=long_prompt, llm=flan_t5 ) qs_str = ( \""Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?\\n\"" + \""If I am 6 ft 4 inches, how tall am I in centimeters?\\n\"" + \""Who was the 12th person on the moon?\"" + \""How many eyes does a blade of grass have?\"" ) print(llm_chain.run(qs_str))\n\nIf I am 6 ft 4 inches, how tall am I in centimeters\n\nAs expected, the results are not helpful. We’ll see later that more powerful LLMs can do this.\n\nThe OpenAI endpoints in LangChain connect to OpenAI directly or via Azure. We need an OpenAI account and API key to use these endpoints.\n\nOnce you have an API key, we add it to the OPENAI_API_TOKEN environment variable.

We can do the same for multiple questions using generate:\n\nqs = [ {'question': \""Which NFL team won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season?\""}, {'question': \""If I am 6 ft 4 inches, how tall am I in centimeters?\""}, {'question': \""Who was the 12th person on the moon?\""}, {'question': \""How many eyes does a blade of grass have?\""} ] llm_chain.generate(qs)\n\nLLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text=' The Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl in the 2010 season.', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text=' 193.04 centimeters', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})], [Generation(text=' Charles Duke was the 12th person on the moon.

It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n"",""relevance_score"":0.99619037},""pageContent"":""Hello is a salutation or greeting in the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\n== Early uses ==\nHello, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the Norwich Courier of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee, which was reprinted that same year in The London Literary Gazette. The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German \""halâ, holâ, emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman\"". It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.Bill Bryson asserts in his book Mother Tongue that \""hello\"" is a contraction of the Old English phrase hál béo þu (\""Hale be thou\"", or \""whole be thou\"", meaning a wish for good health; cf. \""goodbye\"" which is a contraction of \""God be with ye\"").\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nBefore the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as \""Good morning, Doctor\"", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings without time began to catch on.The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nFriend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.\nWhat you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling \""Halloa\"" in the context of telephone conversations.\n\n\n=== Hullo, hallo, and other spellings ===\n\nHello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \""chiefly British variant of hello\"", and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq

# Initialize the ChatGroq class
chat = ChatGroq(temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-32768"")

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate
system = ""You are a helpful assistant.""
human = ""{text}""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])

# Create the chain and invoke it
chain = prompt | chat
chain.invoke({""text"": ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.""})
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: First, install the `langchain-groq` package, which provides the integration between LangChain and the Groq language model.

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. **Import the required classes**: Import the `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts` and the `ChatGroq` class from `langchain_groq`.

3. **Initialize the ChatGroq class**: Create an instance of the `ChatGroq` class, specifying the temperature and the model name you want to use. In this example, we're using the ""mixtral-8x7b-32768"" model.

4. **Create a ChatPromptTemplate**: Define the system and human messages that will be used to create the prompt. In this case, the system message is ""You are a helpful assistant,"" and the human message is ""{text}"".

5. **Create the chain and invoke it**: Use the `|` operator to create the chain from the prompt and the `ChatGroq` instance. Then, invoke the chain by passing the input text as a dictionary.

Alternatively, you can use the following JavaScript code to achieve the same result:

```javascript
import { ChatGroq } from ""@langchain/groq"";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from ""@langchain/core/prompts"";

const model = new ChatGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""],
  [""human"", ""{input}""],
]);
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const response = await chain.invoke({ input: ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs."" });
```

The key steps are similar to the Python example:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `@langchain/groq` and `@langchain/core/prompts` modules.
2. Create a `ChatGroq` instance, passing the API key as an option.
3. Define the prompt using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.
4. Create the chain by piping the prompt through the `ChatGroq` model.
5. Invoke the chain with the input text and await the response.

Both the Python and JavaScript examples demonstrate how to create a simple chain in LangChain using the Groq language model. The process involves initializing the Groq model, defining the prompt, and creating the chain to generate the desired output.",

In this article, we will walk you through how to deploy LangCorn to Vercel.\n\nBefore diving into the details, let’s first understand what LangCorn (https://github.com/msoedov/langcorn) is. LangCorn is a high-performance, scalable, and robust API server developed to ease the deployment of LangChain models and pipelines. It is built on the FastAPI framework and supports custom pipelines and processing. In addition, it provides ready-to-use auth functionality and well-documented RESTful API endpoints.\n\nStep 1: Installation\n\nFirst things first, you need to install LangCorn. To do this, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Here’s how you can install LangCorn:\n\npip install langcorn\n\nNow that you have installed LangCorn, the next step is to create your LangChain model and pipeline. Here’s an example of a LangChain model named ex1.py:\n\nimport os from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI os.environ[\""OPENAI_API_KEY\""] = os.environ.get(\""OPENAI_API_KEY\"", \""sk-********\"") llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\n\nAfter creating your model, you can run your LangCorn FastAPI server with the following command:\n\nlangcorn server examples.ex1:chain\n\nYou can also run multiple chains with the following command:\n\npython -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain\n\nStep 3: Create FastAPI App\n\nThe next step is to create your FastAPI app. Here’s how you can do this:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app:FastAPI = create_service(\""examples.ex1:chain\"")\n\nAnd if you are working with multiple chains, you can do it this way:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app: FastAPI = create_service( \""examples.ex1:chain\"", \""examples.ex2:chain\"", \""examples.ex3:chain\"", \""examples.ex4:sequential_chain\"", \""examples.ex5:conversation\"", \""examples.ex6:conversation_with_summary\"", )\n\nStep 4: Run LangCorn FastAPI server\n\nNow, it’s time to run your LangCorn FastAPI server. You can do this with the following command:\n\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\nStep 5: Deploy to Vercel\n\nHaving your LangCorn FastAPI server running locally is great. However, to make your LangChain models and pipelines accessible to others, you need to deploy your server. Here, we will use Vercel, a popular platform for static sites and Serverless Functions.\n\n\""devCommand\"": This is the command that Vercel will use to start your application during development.\n\n\""builds\"": This is where you specify what Vercel should do to build your application.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using the asyncio event loop.\n\nIn this blog post, we will discuss how to run FastAPI / Uvicorn in Google Colab, a free online notebook for machine learning education and research.\n\nWhat is Google Colab?\n\nGoogle Colab is an online platform that allows you to write and run Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment. It is a free service provided by Google that enables you to use their infrastructure to train and run machine learning models. Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which are essential for training deep learning models.\n\nWhy Run FastAPI / Uvicorn in Google Colab?\n\nRunning FastAPI / Uvicorn in Google Colab can be useful in many scenarios. For example, you might want to test a web application, build an API, or train a machine learning model that requires a web server. By running FastAPI / Uvicorn in Google Colab, you can take advantage of the free resources provided by Google, such as GPUs and TPUs.\n\nHere are the steps to run FastAPI / Uvicorn in Google Colab:\n\nStep 1: Install FastAPI and Uvicorn\n\nFirst, we need to install FastAPI and Uvicorn. We can do this by running the following command in a code cell:\n\n⚠ This code is experimental content and was generated by AI. Please refer to this code as experimental only since we cannot currently guarantee its validity\n\n!pip install fastapi uvicorn\n\nStep 2: Create a FastAPI Application\n\nNext, we need to create a FastAPI application. We can do this by creating a new Python file and adding the following code:\n\n⚠ This code is experimental content and was generated by AI. Please refer to this code as experimental only since we cannot currently guarantee its validity\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\""/\"") async def root(): return {\""message\"": \""Hello World\""}\n\nThis code creates a new FastAPI application with a single route that returns a JSON response with the message “Hello World”.\n\nStep 3: Run the FastAPI Application with Uvicorn\n\nNow that we have created a FastAPI application, we need to run it with Uvicorn. We can do this by adding the following code to a code cell:\n\n⚠ This code is experimental content and was generated by AI. Please refer to this code as experimental only since we cannot currently guarantee its validity\n\nimport uvicorn if __name__ == \""__main__\"": uvicorn.run(app, host=\""0.0.0.0\"", port=8000)\n\nThis code starts a Uvicorn server that listens on port 8000 and serves the FastAPI application.\n\nStep 4: Expose the Uvicorn Server to the Internet\n\nBy default, the Uvicorn server listens on the local machine only. To expose it to the internet, we need to use a tool called ngrok.\n\nNgrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel to localhost, exposing a local web server to the internet. It can be used to test webhooks, APIs, or any other web application that needs to receive requests from the internet.\n\nTo use ngrok, we need to download it and run it in a code cell:\n\n⚠ This code is experimental content and was generated by AI. Please refer to this code as experimental only since we cannot currently guarantee its validity\n\n!wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip !unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip\n\nThen, we can start ngrok by running the following command:\n\n⚠ This code is experimental content and was generated by AI. Please refer to this code as experimental only since we cannot currently guarantee its validity\n\nThis code starts ngrok and creates a secure tunnel to the Uvicorn server running on port 8000.\n\nStep 5: Test the FastAPI Application\n\nNow that we have exposed the Uvicorn server to the internet, we can test the FastAPI application by sending a request to the ngrok URL.\n\nTo get the ngrok URL, we can look at the output of the previous code cell. It should look something like this:\n\n⚠ This code is experimental content and was generated by AI.

Here's an example of how you can create a LangChain pipeline that uses GROQ (a query language for Sanity.io) and make it accessible using FastAPI and Uvicorn in Python:

```python
# app.py
import os
from typing import Any, Dict
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.utilities import SanityClient

app = FastAPI()

# Set up the LangChain pipeline
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ.get(""OPENAI_API_KEY"")
SANITY_PROJECT_ID = os.environ.get(""SANITY_PROJECT_ID"")
SANITY_DATASET = os.environ.get(""SANITY_DATASET"")
SANITY_API_TOKEN = os.environ.get(""SANITY_API_TOKEN"")

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
sanity_client = SanityClient(
    project_id=SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
    dataset=SANITY_DATASET,
    api_token=SANITY_API_TOKEN,
)

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=[""query""],
    template=""Use GROQ to query the Sanity.io dataset and return the relevant results:\n\n{query}"",
)

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

@app.post(""/query"")
async def query(request: Dict[str, Any]):
    query = request[""query""]
    result = chain.run(query)
    return {""result"": result}

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host=""0.0.0.0"", port=8000)
```

In this example, we create a FastAPI application that has a single endpoint `/query`. The endpoint accepts a JSON payload with a `query` field, which is then used to execute a LangChain pipeline that combines an OpenAI language model with a GROQ query to Sanity.io.

Here's how the code works:

1. We import the necessary modules from FastAPI, LangChain, and other libraries.
2. We set up the required environment variables for the OpenAI API key, Sanity.io project ID, dataset, and API token.
3. We create an OpenAI language model and a Sanity.io client instance.
4. We define a prompt template that includes a `query` input variable, which will be used to format the GROQ query.
5. We create a `LLMChain` instance that combines the language model and the prompt template.
6. We define a FastAPI endpoint `/query` that accepts a JSON payload with a `query` field. This endpoint calls the `chain.run()` method with the provided query and returns the result.
7. Finally, we run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn.

To use this application, you would need to have the required environment variables set and make a POST request to the `/query` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the GROQ query. For example:

```
POST /query
{
    ""query"": ""*[_type == 'post'] { title, slug, publishedAt }""
}
```

This would return a JSON response with the results of the GROQ query.

Remember to replace the environment variables with your own Sanity.io and OpenAI API keys and credentials.",

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq

# Initialize the ChatGroq class
chat = ChatGroq(temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-32768"")

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate
system = ""You are a helpful assistant.""
human = ""{text}""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])

# Create the chain and invoke it
chain = prompt | chat
chain.invoke({""text"": ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.""})
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: First, install the `langchain-groq` package, which provides the integration between LangChain and the Groq language model.

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. **Import the required classes**: Import the `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts` and the `ChatGroq` class from `langchain_groq`.

3. **Initialize the ChatGroq class**: Create an instance of the `ChatGroq` class, specifying the temperature and the model name you want to use. In this example, we're using the ""mixtral-8x7b-32768"" model.

4. **Create a ChatPromptTemplate**: Define the system and human messages that will be used to create the prompt. In this case, the system message is ""You are a helpful assistant,"" and the human message is ""{text}"".

5. **Create the chain and invoke it**: Use the `|` operator to create the chain from the prompt and the `ChatGroq` instance. Then, invoke the chain by passing the input text as a dictionary.

Alternatively, you can use the following JavaScript code to achieve the same result:

```javascript
import { ChatGroq } from ""@langchain/groq"";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from ""@langchain/core/prompts"";

const model = new ChatGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""],
  [""human"", ""{input}""],
]);
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const response = await chain.invoke({ input: ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs."" });
```

The key steps are similar to the Python example:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `@langchain/groq` and `@langchain/core/prompts` modules.
2. Create a `ChatGroq` instance, passing the API key as an option.
3. Define the prompt using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.
4. Create the chain by piping the prompt through the `ChatGroq` model.
5. Invoke the chain with the input text and await the response.

Both the Python and JavaScript examples demonstrate how to create a simple chain in LangChain using the Groq language model. The process involves initializing the Groq model, defining the prompt, and creating the chain to generate the desired output.","{""sources"":[{""metadata"":{""type"":""model_response"",""citations"":[{""end"":87,""text"":""LangCorn"",""start"":79,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":146,""text"":""leverage the FastAPI framework."",""start"":115,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":179,""text"":""install LangCorn with pip"",""start"":154,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":208,""text"":""create your LangChain model"",""start"":181,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":250,""text"":""run the LangCorn FastAPI server."",""start"":218,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":288,""text"":""deploy the server to Vercel."",""start"":260,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":305,""text"":""LangServe"",""start"":296,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":351,""text"":""deploying LangChain applications."",""start"":318,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":412,""text"":""AWS"",""start"":409,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":419,""text"":""Azure"",""start"":414,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":434,""text"":""GCP Cloud Run"",""start"":421,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":447,""text"":""Railway"",""start"":440,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":472,""text"":""FastAPI."",""start"":464,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":591,""text"":""uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000."",""start"":547,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":622,""text"":""step-by-step guide"",""start"":604,""document_ids"":[""web-search_4"",""web-search_7""]},{""end"":657,""text"":""Vercel"",""start"":651,""document_ids"":[""web-search_4"",""web-search_7""]},{""end"":718,""text"":""installing LangCorn"",""start"":699,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":749,""text"":""creating your LangChain model"",""start"":720,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":786,""text"":""running the LangCorn FastAPI server"",""start"":751,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":814,""text"":""deploying it to Vercel."",""start"":791,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":856,""text"":""Jina AI Cloud with langchain-serve"",""start"":822,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":940,""text"":""cloud or on-premises"",""start"":920,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1001,""text"":""export them as Kubernetes or Docker Compose YAMLs."",""start"":951,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1142,""text"":""lc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>"",""start"":1090,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1162,""text"":""Deta Space."",""start"":1151,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1197,""text"":""create a new Python project"",""start"":1170,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1236,""text"":""install the necessary dependencies"",""start"":1202,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1302,""text"":""LangChain, FastAPI, uvicorn, openai and python-dotenv."",""start"":1248,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1339,""text"":""initiate a virtual environment"",""start"":1309,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1355,""text"":""create the API"",""start"":1341,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1375,""text"":""run it locally."",""start"":1360,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1436,""text"":""deploy it on Deta Space."",""start"":1412,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":1500,""text"":""Docker on Huggingface."",""start"":1478,""document_ids"":[""web-search_5""]},{""end"":1540,""text"":""Dockerfile for your application"",""start"":1509,""document_ids"":[""web-search_5""]},{""end"":1578,""text"":""copy its contents into the container"",""start"":1542,""document_ids"":[""web-search_5""]},{""end"":1617,""text"":""run the application using uvicorn."",""start"":1583,""document_ids"":[""web-search_5""]}],""token_count"":{""total_tokens"":21066,""billed_tokens"":20314,""prompt_tokens"":20674,""response_tokens"":392,""search_query_tokens"":7},""search_queries"":[{""text"":""deploy langchain app to FastAPI"",""generation_id"":""1442fec7-14ca-410d-b1bb-6329b293055a""}],""search_results"":[{""connector"":{""id"":""web-search""},""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_3"",""web-search_4"",""web-search_5"",""web-search_6"",""web-search_7"",""web-search_9""],""search_query"":{""text"":""deploy langchain app to FastAPI"",""generation_id"":""1442fec7-14ca-410d-b1bb-6329b293055a""}}],""relevance_score"":0.9999097},""pageContent"":""To deploy a LangChain application to FastAPI, you have several options:\n1. Use LangCorn, an API server designed to leverage the FastAPI framework. First, install LangCorn with pip, create your LangChain model and then run the LangCorn FastAPI server. Finally, deploy the server to Vercel.\n2. Use LangServe, a tool for deploying LangChain applications. LangServe supports various deployment options, including AWS, Azure, GCP Cloud Run, and Railway, in addition to FastAPI. To deploy to FastAPI, simply run the LangServe instance using the command uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000.\n3. Follow a step-by-step guide to deploy LangChain apps to Vercel along with FastAPI. The process includes installing LangCorn, creating your LangChain model, running the LangCorn FastAPI server and deploying it to Vercel.\n4. Use Jina AI Cloud with langchain-serve to deploy your LangChain apps. You can deploy your apps on the cloud or on-premises, and even export them as Kubernetes or Docker Compose YAMLs. If you already have a FastAPI app, you can deploy it on Jina AI Cloud using the command lc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>.\n5. Use Deta Space. First, create a new Python project and install the necessary dependencies, including LangChain, FastAPI, uvicorn, openai and python-dotenv. Then, initiate a virtual environment, create the API and run it locally. Once you're satisfied with the API, deploy it on Deta Space.\n6. Deploy your FastAPI application using Docker on Huggingface.

In this article, we will walk you through how to deploy LangCorn to Vercel.\n\nBefore diving into the details, let’s first understand what LangCorn (https://github.com/msoedov/langcorn) is. LangCorn is a high-performance, scalable, and robust API server developed to ease the deployment of LangChain models and pipelines. It is built on the FastAPI framework and supports custom pipelines and processing. In addition, it provides ready-to-use auth functionality and well-documented RESTful API endpoints.\n\nStep 1: Installation\n\nFirst things first, you need to install LangCorn. To do this, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Here’s how you can install LangCorn:\n\npip install langcorn\n\nNow that you have installed LangCorn, the next step is to create your LangChain model and pipeline. Here’s an example of a LangChain model named ex1.py:\n\nimport os from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI os.environ[\""OPENAI_API_KEY\""] = os.environ.get(\""OPENAI_API_KEY\"", \""sk-********\"") llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\n\nAfter creating your model, you can run your LangCorn FastAPI server with the following command:\n\nlangcorn server examples.ex1:chain\n\nYou can also run multiple chains with the following command:\n\npython -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain\n\nStep 3: Create FastAPI App\n\nThe next step is to create your FastAPI app. Here’s how you can do this:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app:FastAPI = create_service(\""examples.ex1:chain\"")\n\nAnd if you are working with multiple chains, you can do it this way:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app: FastAPI = create_service( \""examples.ex1:chain\"", \""examples.ex2:chain\"", \""examples.ex3:chain\"", \""examples.ex4:sequential_chain\"", \""examples.ex5:conversation\"", \""examples.ex6:conversation_with_summary\"", )\n\nStep 4: Run LangCorn FastAPI server\n\nNow, it’s time to run your LangCorn FastAPI server. You can do this with the following command:\n\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\nStep 5: Deploy to Vercel\n\nHaving your LangCorn FastAPI server running locally is great.

The secrets file should be a .env file containing the secrets.\n\nlcserve deploy jcloud app --secrets .env\n\nLet's take an example of a simple app that uses OPENAI_API_KEY stored as secrets.\n\nThis app directory contains the following files:\n\n. ├── main.py # The app ├── jcloud.yml # JCloud deployment config file ├── README.md # This README file ├── requirements.txt # The requirements file for the app └── secrets.env # The secrets file containing the redis credentials\n\nNote secret.env in this directory is a dummy file. You should replace it with your own secrets after creating a Redis instance. (For example with Upstash), such as:\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx\n\nmain.py will look like:\n\n# main.py from lcserve import serving from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\""subject\""], template=\""Write me a short poem about {subject}?\"", ) @serving(openai_tracing=True) def poem(subject: str, **kwargs): tracing_handler = kwargs.get(\""tracing_handler\"") chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) return chain.run(subject)\n\nIn the above example, the app will use OPENAI_API_KEY provided by the secrets to interact with OpenAI.\n\nThen you can deploy using the following command and interact with the deployed endpoint.\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud main --secrets secrets.env\n\n⏱️ Trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously using @job decorator.\n\nlc-serve is a simple CLI that helps you to deploy your agents on Jina AI Cloud (JCloud)\n\nDeploy your app locally\n\nlc-serve deploy local app\n\nExport your app as Kubernetes YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind kubernetes --path .\n\nExport your app as Docker Compose YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind docker-compose --path .\n\nDeploy your app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app\n\nDeploy FastAPI app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>\n\nUpdate existing app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app --app-id <app-id>\n\nGet app status on JCloud\n\nlc-serve status <app-id>\n\nList all apps on JCloud\n\nRemove app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve remove <app-id>\n\nlc-serve pause <app-id>\n\nResume app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve resume <app-id>\n\n💡 JCloud Deployment\n\n⚙️ Configurations\n\nFor JCloud deployment, you can configure your application infrastructure by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option. The supported configurations are:\n\nInstance type (instance), as defined by Jina AI Cloud.\n\nMinimum number of replicas for your application (autoscale_min). Setting it 0 enables serverless.\n\nDisk size (disk_size), in GB. The default value is 1 GB.\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 1.5G\n\nYou can alternatively include a jcloud.yaml file in your application directory with the desired configurations. However, please note that if the --config option is explicitly used in the command line interface, the local jcloud.yaml file will be disregarded. The command line provided configuration file will take precedence.\n\nIf you don't provide a configuration file or a specific configuration isn't specified, the following default settings will be applied:\n\ninstance: C3 autoscale_min: 1 disk_size: 1G\n\nApplications hosted on JCloud are priced in two categories:\n\nBase credits are charged to ensure high availability for your application by maintaining at least one instance running continuously, ready to handle incoming requests. If you wish to stop the serving application, you can either remove the app completely or put it on pause, the latter allows you to resume the app serving based on persisted configurations (refer to lc-serve CLI section for more information). Both options will halt the consumption of credits.\n\nActual credits charged for base credits are calculated based on the instance type as defined by Jina AI Cloud.\n\nBy default, instance type C3 is used with a minimum of 1 instance and Amazon EFS disk of size 1G, which means that if your application is served on JCloud, you will be charged ~10 credits per hour.\n\nYou can change the instance type and the minimum number of instances by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option. For example, if you want to use instance type C4 with a minimum of 0 replicas, and 2G EFS disk, you can provide the following configuration file:\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 2G\n\nServing credits are charged when your application is actively serving incoming requests.\n\nActual credits charged for serving credits are calculated based on the credits for the instance type multiplied by the duration for which your application serves requests.\n\nYou are charged for each second your application is serving requests.\n\nTotal credits charged = Base credits + Serving credits. (Jina AI Cloud defines each credit as €0.005)\n\nConsider an HTTP application that has served requests for 10 minutes in the last hour and uses a custom config:\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 2G\n\nTotal credits per hour charged would be 3.33. The calculation is as follows:\n\nC4 instance has an hourly credit rate of 20. EFS has hourly credit rate of 0.104 per GB. Base credits = 0 + 2 * 0.104 = 0.208 (since `autoscale_min` is 0) Serving credits = 20 * 10/60 = 3.33 Total credits per hour = 0.208 + 3.33 = 3.538\n\nConsider a WebSocket application that had active connections for 20 minutes in the last hour and uses the default configuration.\n\ninstance: C3 autoscale_min: 1 disk_size: 1G\n\nTotal credits per hour charged would be 13.33. The calculation is as follows:\n\nC3 instance has an hourly credit rate of 10. EFS has hourly credit rate of 0.104 per GB. Base credits = 10 + 1 * 0.104 = 10.104 (since `autoscale_min` is 1) Serving credits = 10 * 20/60 = 3.33 Total credits per hour = 10.104 + 3.33 = 13.434\n\n❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nlc-serve command not found\n\nMy client that connects to the JCloud hosted App gets timed-out, what should I do?\n\nHow to pass environment variables to the app?\n\nJCloud deployment failed at pushing image to Jina Hubble, what should I do?\n\nDebug babyagi playground request/response for external integration\n\nlc-serve command not found\n\nlc-serve command is registered during langchain-serve installation. If you get command not found: lc-serve error, please replace lc-serve command with python -m lcserve & retry.\n\nMy client that connects to the JCloud hosted App gets timed-out, what should I do?\n\nIf you make long HTTP/ WebSocket requests, the default timeout value (2 minutes) might not be suitable for your use case. You can provide a custom timeout value during JCloud deployment by using the --timeout argument.\n\nAdditionally, for HTTP, you may also experience timeouts due to limitations in the OSS we used in langchain-serve. While we are working to permanently address this issue, we recommend using HTTP/1.1 in your client as a temporary workaround.\n\nFor WebSocket, please note that the connection will be closed if idle for more than 5 minutes.\n\nHow to pass environment variables to the app?\n\nWe provide 2 options to pass environment variables:\n\nUse --env during app deployment to load env variables from a .env file. For example, lc-serve deploy jcloud app --env some.env will load all env variables from some.env file and pass them to the app. These env variables will be available in the app as os.environ['ENV_VAR_NAME'].\n\nYou can also pass env variables while sending requests to the app both in HTTP and WebSocket. envs field in the request body is used to pass env variables. For example\n\n{ \""question\"": \""What is the meaning of life?\"", \""envs\"": { \""ENV_VAR_NAME\"": \""ENV_VAR_VALUE\"" } }\n\nJCloud deployment failed at pushing image to Jina Hubble, what should I do?\n\nPlease use --verbose and retry to get more information. If you are operating on computer with arm64 arch, please retry with --platform linux/amd64 so the image can be built correctly.\n\nDebug babyagi playground request/response for external integration\n\nExpand 1. Start textual console in a terminal (exclude following groups to reduce the noise in logging)\n\n```bash textual console -x EVENT -x SYSTEM -x DEBUG ```\n\nStart the playground with --verbose flag. Start interacting and see the logs in the console.\n\nlc-serve playground babyagi --verbose\n\n📣 Reach out to us\n\nWant to deploy your LLM apps on your own infrastructure with all capabilities of Jina AI Cloud?\n\nEnd to end LLM observability\n\nand more on auto-pilot!\n\nJoin us on Discord and we'd be happy to hear more about your use case."",""timestamp"":""2024-01-09T17:03:31"",""relevance_score"":0.99887526},""pageContent"":""⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE: This repository is no longer maintained.\n\n⚡ LangChain Apps on Production with Jina & FastAPI 🚀\n\nJina is an open-source framework for building scalable multi modal AI apps on Production.

(For example with Upstash), such as:\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx\n\nmain.py will look like:\n\n# main.py from lcserve import serving from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\""subject\""], template=\""Write me a short poem about {subject}?\"", ) @serving(openai_tracing=True) def poem(subject: str, **kwargs): tracing_handler = kwargs.get(\""tracing_handler\"") chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) return chain.run(subject)\n\nIn the above example, the app will use OPENAI_API_KEY provided by the secrets to interact with OpenAI.\n\nThen you can deploy using the following command and interact with the deployed endpoint.\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud main --secrets secrets.env\n\n⏱️ Trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously using @job decorator.\n\nlc-serve is a simple CLI that helps you to deploy your agents on Jina AI Cloud (JCloud)\n\nDeploy your app locally\n\nlc-serve deploy local app\n\nExport your app as Kubernetes YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind kubernetes --path .\n\nExport your app as Docker Compose YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind docker-compose --path .\n\nDeploy your app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app\n\nDeploy FastAPI app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>\n\nUpdate existing app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app --app-id <app-id>\n\nGet app status on JCloud\n\nlc-serve status <app-id>\n\nList all apps on JCloud\n\nRemove app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve remove <app-id>\n\nlc-serve pause <app-id>\n\nResume app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve resume <app-id>\n\n💡 JCloud Deployment\n\n⚙️ Configurations\n\nFor JCloud deployment, you can configure your application infrastructure by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option. The supported configurations are:\n\nInstance type (instance), as defined by Jina AI Cloud.\n\nMinimum number of replicas for your application (autoscale_min). Setting it 0 enables serverless.\n\nDisk size (disk_size), in GB. The default value is 1 GB.\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 1.5G\n\nYou can alternatively include a jcloud.yaml file in your application directory with the desired configurations. However, please note that if the --config option is explicitly used in the command line interface, the local jcloud.yaml file will be disregarded. The command line provided configuration file will take precedence.\n\nIf you don't provide a configuration file or a specific configuration isn't specified, the following default settings will be applied:\n\ninstance: C3 autoscale_min: 1 disk_size: 1G\n\nApplications hosted on JCloud are priced in two categories:\n\nBase credits are charged to ensure high availability for your application by maintaining at least one instance running continuously, ready to handle incoming requests. If you wish to stop the serving application, you can either remove the app completely or put it on pause, the latter allows you to resume the app serving based on persisted configurations (refer to lc-serve CLI section for more information). Both options will halt the consumption of credits.\n\nActual credits charged for base credits are calculated based on the instance type as defined by Jina AI Cloud.\n\nBy default, instance type C3 is used with a minimum of 1 instance and Amazon EFS disk of size 1G, which means that if your application is served on JCloud, you will be charged ~10 credits per hour.\n\nYou can change the instance type and the minimum number of instances by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option. For example, if you want to use instance type C4 with a minimum of 0 replicas, and 2G EFS disk, you can provide the following configuration file:\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 2G\n\nServing credits are charged when your application is actively serving incoming requests.\n\nActual credits charged for serving credits are calculated based on the credits for the instance type multiplied by the duration for which your application serves requests.\n\nYou are charged for each second your application is serving requests.\n\nTotal credits charged = Base credits + Serving credits. (Jina AI Cloud defines each credit as €0.005)\n\nConsider an HTTP application that has served requests for 10 minutes in the last hour and uses a custom config:\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 2G\n\nTotal credits per hour charged would be 3.33. The calculation is as follows:\n\nC4 instance has an hourly credit rate of 20. EFS has hourly credit rate of 0.104 per GB. Base credits = 0 + 2 * 0.104 = 0.208 (since `autoscale_min` is 0) Serving credits = 20 * 10/60 = 3.33 Total credits per hour = 0.208 + 3.33 = 3.538\n\nConsider a WebSocket application that had active connections for 20 minutes in the last hour and uses the default configuration.\n\ninstance: C3 autoscale_min: 1 disk_size: 1G\n\nTotal credits per hour charged would be 13.33. The calculation is as follows:\n\nC3 instance has an hourly credit rate of 10. EFS has hourly credit rate of 0.104 per GB. Base credits = 10 + 1 * 0.104 = 10.104 (since `autoscale_min` is 1) Serving credits = 10 * 20/60 = 3.33 Total credits per hour = 10.104 + 3.33 = 13.434\n\n❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nlc-serve command not found\n\nMy client that connects to the JCloud hosted App gets timed-out, what should I do?\n\nHow to pass environment variables to the app?\n\nJCloud deployment failed at pushing image to Jina Hubble, what should I do?\n\nDebug babyagi playground request/response for external integration\n\nlc-serve command not found\n\nlc-serve command is registered during langchain-serve installation. If you get command not found: lc-serve error, please replace lc-serve command with python -m lcserve & retry.\n\nMy client that connects to the JCloud hosted App gets timed-out, what should I do?\n\nIf you make long HTTP/ WebSocket requests, the default timeout value (2 minutes) might not be suitable for your use case. You can provide a custom timeout value during JCloud deployment by using the --timeout argument.\n\nAdditionally, for HTTP, you may also experience timeouts due to limitations in the OSS we used in langchain-serve. While we are working to permanently address this issue, we recommend using HTTP/1.1 in your client as a temporary workaround.\n\nFor WebSocket, please note that the connection will be closed if idle for more than 5 minutes.\n\nHow to pass environment variables to the app?\n\nWe provide 2 options to pass environment variables:\n\nUse --env during app deployment to load env variables from a .env file. For example, lc-serve deploy jcloud app --env some.env will load all env variables from some.env file and pass them to the app. These env variables will be available in the app as os.environ['ENV_VAR_NAME'].\n\nYou can also pass env variables while sending requests to the app both in HTTP and WebSocket. envs field in the request body is used to pass env variables. For example\n\n{ \""question\"": \""What is the meaning of life?\"", \""envs\"": { \""ENV_VAR_NAME\"": \""ENV_VAR_VALUE\"" } }\n\nJCloud deployment failed at pushing image to Jina Hubble, what should I do?\n\nPlease use --verbose and retry to get more information. If you are operating on computer with arm64 arch, please retry with --platform linux/amd64 so the image can be built correctly.\n\nDebug babyagi playground request/response for external integration\n\nExpand 1. Start textual console in a terminal (exclude following groups to reduce the noise in logging)\n\n```bash textual console -x EVENT -x SYSTEM -x DEBUG ```\n\nStart the playground with --verbose flag.

1. **Use LangCorn**:
   - First, install LangCorn with `pip install langcorn`.
   - Create your LangChain model.
   - Run the LangCorn FastAPI server with the command `langcorn server examples.ex1:chain`.
   - Deploy the server to Vercel.

2. **Use LangServe**:
   - LangServe supports various deployment options, including FastAPI.
   - To deploy to FastAPI, simply run the LangServe instance using the command `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

3. **Deploy LangChain apps to Vercel with FastAPI**:
   - Follow a step-by-step guide to deploy LangChain apps to Vercel along with FastAPI.
   - The process includes installing LangCorn, creating your LangChain model, running the LangCorn FastAPI server, and deploying it to Vercel.

4. **Use Jina AI Cloud with langchain-serve**:
   - Deploy your LangChain apps on the cloud or on-premises using Jina AI Cloud.
   - If you already have a FastAPI app, you can deploy it on Jina AI Cloud using the command `lc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>`.

5. **Use Deta Space**:
   - Create a new Python project and install the necessary dependencies, including LangChain, FastAPI, uvicorn, OpenAI, and python-dotenv.
   - Initiate a virtual environment, create the API, and run it locally.
   - Once you're satisfied with the API, deploy it on Deta Space.

6. **Deploy your FastAPI application using Docker on Hugging Face**:
   - Write a Dockerfile for your application, copy its contents into the container, and run the application using `uvicorn`.

The general steps to deploy a LangChain app to FastAPI are:

1. Install the necessary dependencies (LangChain, FastAPI, uvicorn, etc.).
2. Create your LangChain model and pipeline.
3. Set up a FastAPI app that leverages your LangChain model.
4. Run the FastAPI server locally using `uvicorn`.
5. Deploy the FastAPI application to a platform like Vercel, Jina AI Cloud, Deta Space, or Hugging Face.

The specific implementation details will depend on the deployment option you choose. Each approach has its own set of steps and considerations, so be sure to follow the documentation or guides for the platform you've selected.",

Here's how you can create a simple chain in LangChain with Groq:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq

# Initialize the ChatGroq class
chat = ChatGroq(temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-32768"")

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate
system = ""You are a helpful assistant.""
human = ""{text}""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])

# Create the chain and invoke it
chain = prompt | chat
chain.invoke({""text"": ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.""})
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: First, install the `langchain-groq` package, which provides the integration between LangChain and the Groq language model.

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. **Import the required classes**: Import the `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts` and the `ChatGroq` class from `langchain_groq`.

3. **Initialize the ChatGroq class**: Create an instance of the `ChatGroq` class, specifying the temperature and the model name you want to use. In this example, we're using the ""mixtral-8x7b-32768"" model.

4. **Create a ChatPromptTemplate**: Define the system and human messages that will be used to create the prompt. In this case, the system message is ""You are a helpful assistant,"" and the human message is ""{text}"".

5. **Create the chain and invoke it**: Use the `|` operator to create the chain from the prompt and the `ChatGroq` instance. Then, invoke the chain by passing the input text as a dictionary.

Alternatively, you can use the following JavaScript code to achieve the same result:

```javascript
import { ChatGroq } from ""@langchain/groq"";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from ""@langchain/core/prompts"";

const model = new ChatGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""],
  [""human"", ""{input}""],
]);
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const response = await chain.invoke({ input: ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs."" });
```

The key steps are similar to the Python example:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `@langchain/groq` and `@langchain/core/prompts` modules.
2. Create a `ChatGroq` instance, passing the API key as an option.
3. Define the prompt using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.
4. Create the chain by piping the prompt through the `ChatGroq` model.
5. Invoke the chain with the input text and await the response.

Install LangCorn using the command: \n```bash\npip install langcorn\n```\n2. Create your LangChain model and pipeline. Here's an example of a LangChain model:\n```python\nimport os from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI os.environ[\""OPENAI_API_KEY\""] = os.environ.get(\""OPENAI_API_KEY\"", \""sk-********\"") llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\n```\n3. Run your LangCorn FastAPI server using the command:\n```bash\nlangcorn server examples.ex1:chain\n```\nYou can also run multiple chains with the following command:\n```bash\npython -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain\n```\n4. Create your FastAPI app using the following code:\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app:FastAPI = create_service(\""examples.ex1:chain\"")\n```\nIf you have multiple chains, use this code:\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app: FastAPI = create_service( \""examples.ex1:chain\"", \""examples.ex2:chain\"", \""examples.ex3:chain\"", \""examples.ex4:sequential_chain\"", \""examples.ex5:conversation\"", \""examples.ex6:conversation_with_summary\"", )\n```\n5. Run your LangCorn FastAPI server with the command:\n```bash\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n```\n6. Deploy the server to Vercel. Use the following configuration in your `vercel.json` file:\n```json\n{ \""devCommand\"": \""uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000\"", \""builds\"": [ { \""src\"": \""examples/app.py\"", \""use\"": \""@vercel/python\"" } ], \""routes\"": [ { \""src\"": \""/(.*)\"", \""dest\"": \""examples/app.py\"" } ] }\n```\n## Using LangServe\n1. Install LangServe using the command:\n```bash\npip install \""langserve[all]\""\""\n```\nOr install the client code with:\n```bash\npip install \""langserve[client]\""\""\n```\nOr the server code with:\n```bash\npip install \""langserve[server]\""\""\n```\n2. Use the LangChain CLI to create a LangServe project. First, make sure you have LangChain CLI installed:\n```bash\npip install -U langchain-cli\n```\nThen, execute the following command:\n```bash\nlangchain app new ../path/to/directory\n```\n3. A sample code for a FastAPI application that uses LangServe is as follows:\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI from langserve import add_routes app = FastAPI( title=\""LangChain Server\"", version=\""1.0\"", description=\""A simple api server using Langchain's Runnable interfaces\"", ) add_routes( app, ChatOpenAI(), path=\""/openai\"", ) add_routes( app, ChatAnthropic(), path=\""/anthropic\"", ) model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\""tell me a joke about {topic}\"") add_routes( app, prompt | model, path=\""/joke\"", ) if __name__ == \""__main__\"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=\""localhost\"", port=8000)\n```\nYou will also need to set up your environment variables, for instance:\n```\n.env OPENAI_API_KEY=\n```\n4. Run the project on your local machine to test it:\n```bash\nuvicorn app.main:app --reload\n```\n## Using Langchain-serve\n1. Install Langchain-serve:\n```bash\npip install langchain-serve\n```\n2. Define your API using the @serving decorator, or build and deploy a Slack bot using the @slackbot decorator.\n3. Deploy your app locally with the command:\n```bash\nlc-serve deploy local app\n```\n4. Export your app. For example, to export it as a Kubernetes YAML file, use the command:\n```bash\nlc-serve export app --kind kubernetes --path .\n```\n5. Deploy the app on Jina AI Cloud:\n```bash\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app\n```\nAlternatively, you can deploy your LangChain app with FastAPI and Vercel in five minutes by following this step-by-step Python tutorial.

In this article, we will walk you through how to deploy LangCorn to Vercel.\n\nBefore diving into the details, let’s first understand what LangCorn (https://github.com/msoedov/langcorn) is. LangCorn is a high-performance, scalable, and robust API server developed to ease the deployment of LangChain models and pipelines. It is built on the FastAPI framework and supports custom pipelines and processing. In addition, it provides ready-to-use auth functionality and well-documented RESTful API endpoints.\n\nStep 1: Installation\n\nFirst things first, you need to install LangCorn. To do this, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Here’s how you can install LangCorn:\n\npip install langcorn\n\nNow that you have installed LangCorn, the next step is to create your LangChain model and pipeline. Here’s an example of a LangChain model named ex1.py:\n\nimport os from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI os.environ[\""OPENAI_API_KEY\""] = os.environ.get(\""OPENAI_API_KEY\"", \""sk-********\"") llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\n\nAfter creating your model, you can run your LangCorn FastAPI server with the following command:\n\nlangcorn server examples.ex1:chain\n\nYou can also run multiple chains with the following command:\n\npython -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain\n\nStep 3: Create FastAPI App\n\nThe next step is to create your FastAPI app. Here’s how you can do this:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app:FastAPI = create_service(\""examples.ex1:chain\"")\n\nAnd if you are working with multiple chains, you can do it this way:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app: FastAPI = create_service( \""examples.ex1:chain\"", \""examples.ex2:chain\"", \""examples.ex3:chain\"", \""examples.ex4:sequential_chain\"", \""examples.ex5:conversation\"", \""examples.ex6:conversation_with_summary\"", )\n\nStep 4: Run LangCorn FastAPI server\n\nNow, it’s time to run your LangCorn FastAPI server. You can do this with the following command:\n\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\nStep 5: Deploy to Vercel\n\nHaving your LangCorn FastAPI server running locally is great. However, to make your LangChain models and pipelines accessible to others, you need to deploy your server. Here, we will use Vercel, a popular platform for static sites and Serverless Functions.\n\n\""devCommand\"": This is the command that Vercel will use to start your application during development.\n\n\""builds\"": This is where you specify what Vercel should do to build your application. The \""src\"" property indicates the entry point for your application, and \""use\"" property denotes the builder.\n\n\""routes\"": This part is where you specify routing rules for your application. The \""src\"" property is the path of the request, and the \""dest\"" is the destination of the route.\n\nIn your case, you might want to create a vercel.json file in the root directory of your repository that looks something like this:\n\n{ \""devCommand\"": \""uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000\"", \""builds\"": [ { \""src\"": \""examples/app.py\"", \""use\"": \""@vercel/python\"" } ], \""routes\"": [ { \""src\"": \""/(.*)\"", \""dest\"": \""examples/app.py\"" } ] }\n\nSync your private GitHub repo with Vercel: Log into your Vercel account and head over to the Vercel dashboard. Click on the “New Project” button and select “Import Git Repository”. You’ll need to provide the URL of your private GitHub repository and grant Vercel access to it.\n\nConfigure the project: On the “Import Git Repository” page, Vercel will automatically fill in the “Project Name” field with the name of your repository. You can change this if you wish. Make sure that the “Root Directory” field is empty, and then click “Deploy”.\n\nDeployment: Vercel will now clone your repository, install any dependencies, run the build command, and then deploy your application. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL where you can access your live application.\n\nRemember, every time you push changes to the master branch of your GitHub repository, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your application.\n\nAnd that’s it! You have successfully deployed your LangCorn FastAPI application to Vercel.

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Docker allows us to containerize our application for easy deployment, and Huggingface provides a platform to deploy and share models and applications.\n\nDeployment platforms and the problems I faced\n\nDeploying the APIs on Vercel has been my go-to choose, thanks to its user-friendly interface and the 1 GB memory offered in the free tier. It’s been smooth sailing for all my projects, except for one of my projects. The requirements.txt file that contained packages exceeding the combined unzipped size limit of 250 MB causing it to crash.\n\nAlthough I have used Render very minimally, I did check this platform since I had a deadline to submit the project in a hackathon and I was desperate to deploy my API. Render works on Python==3.7 and my application had packages that needed Python>=3.9. I forced Render to use Python>=3.9 but this was not all. Applications running on Render's free tier will only be up for 15 minutes and will go to sleep after that.\n\nDue to these reasons, I deployed my API on Huggingface and it was so easy with no issues.\n\nBasic understanding of FastAPI.\n\nA Huggingface account\n\nStep 1: Create a new Docker Space 🐳\n\nNext, you can choose any name you prefer for your project, select a license, and use Docker as the software development kit (SDK). There are many docker templates available which you can choose from. I'll start with a blank docker template. Then click on the Create Space button.\n\nStep 2: Set Up Your FastAPI Application\n\nSo, now that a new Space has been set up, I'll create a simple application that can generate text given any prompt using Clarifai and Langchain.\n\nThe sample app will consist of the following three files:\n\nrequirements.txt - Lists the dependencies of a Python project or application.\n\nTextGen/router.py - A Python script where we will write our FastAPI app.\n\nTextGen/ConfigEnv.py - A Python script where we will handle the environment variables.\n\nDockerfile - Sets up our environment, installs requirements.txt, then launches app.py.\n\nStep 3: Requirements.txt\n\nList the Python packages and their version in a file named requirements.txt.\n\nfastapi==0.99.1 uvicorn requests pydantic==1.10.12 langchain clarifai Pillow\n\nStep 4: Setting up the FastAPI Application\n\nIf you are new to using Clarifai, let me give you a quick intro to the platform.\n\nClarifai is an AI-powered platform that specializes in Computer vision, Natural Language Processing, LLMs, and all the latest trendy technology solutions. With only a few steps the entire business solution can be built.\n\nThe following code defines a FastAPI web application that uses the Clarifai and Langchain libraries to generate text based on user input. The app itself is a simple single-endpoint API. The /generate endpoint takes in text and uses a Langchain pipeline to generate a completion, which it then returns as a response. I have used Cohere's text generation model in this application.\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel from .ConfigEnv import config from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware from langchain.llms import Clarifai from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from TextGen import app class Generate(BaseModel): text:str def generate_text(prompt: str): if prompt == \""\"": return {\""detail\"": \""Please provide a prompt.\""} else: prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt, input_variables=['Prompt']) llm = Clarifai( pat = config.CLARIFAI_PAT, user_id = config.USER_ID, app_id = config.APP_ID, model_id = config.MODEL_ID, model_version_id=config.MODEL_VERSION_ID, ) llmchain = LLMChain( prompt=prompt, llm=llm ) llm_response = llmchain.run({\""Prompt\"": prompt}) return Generate(text=llm_response) app.add_middleware( CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\""*\""], allow_credentials=True, allow_methods=[\""*\""], allow_headers=[\""*\""], ) @app.get(\""/\"", tags=[\""Home\""]) def api_home(): return {'detail': 'Welcome to FastAPI TextGen Tutorial!'} @app.post(\""/api/generate\"", summary=\""Generate text from prompt\"", tags=[\""Generate\""], response_model=Generate) def inference(input_prompt: str): return generate_text(prompt=input_prompt)\n\nI have linked the TextGen [GitHubhttps://github.com/HemanthSai7/FastAPI-Deployement) repository for the entire codebase.\n\nStep 5: The Dockerfile!\n\nIn this step, we will write a Dockerfile that sets up a Python 3.9 environment, installs the packages listed in requirements.txt, and starts a FastAPI app on port 7860.\n\nLet's understand how a Dockerfile is set up.\n\nThe preceding line specifies that we're going to use the official Python 3.9 Docker image as the base image for our container. This image is provided by Docker Hub, and it contains all the necessary files to run Python 3.9.\n\nThe preceding line copies all the files from our local directory, hence . to the root directory, hence again . inside the container. So . basically, means copying all files from the root directory in the root directory of the container.\n\nThis line sets the working directory inside the container to / i.e. the root directory. This is where we'll copy our application code and dependencies.\n\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /requirements.txt\n\nThis line uses pip to install the packages listed in requirements.txt.

## Using LangCorn
1. Install LangCorn using the command: 
```bash
pip install langcorn
```
2. Create your LangChain model and pipeline. Here's an example of a LangChain model:
```python
import os
from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI

os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = os.environ.get(""OPENAI_API_KEY"", ""sk-********"")
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)
```
3. Run your LangCorn FastAPI server using the command:
```bash
langcorn server examples.ex1:chain
```
You can also run multiple chains with the following command:
```bash
python -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain
```
4. Create your FastAPI app using the following code:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langcorn import create_service

app:FastAPI = create_service(""examples.ex1:chain"")
```
If you have multiple chains, use this code:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langcorn import create_service

app: FastAPI = create_service(
    """,

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq

# Initialize the ChatGroq class
chat = ChatGroq(temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-32768"")

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate
system = ""You are a helpful assistant.""
human = ""{text}""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])

# Create the chain and invoke it
chain = prompt | chat
chain.invoke({""text"": ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.""})
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: First, install the `langchain-groq` package, which provides the integration between LangChain and the Groq language model.

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. **Import the required classes**: Import the `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts` and the `ChatGroq` class from `langchain_groq`.

3. **Initialize the ChatGroq class**: Create an instance of the `ChatGroq` class, specifying the temperature and the model name you want to use. In this example, we're using the ""mixtral-8x7b-32768"" model.

4. **Create a ChatPromptTemplate**: Define the system and human messages that will be used to create the prompt. In this case, the system message is ""You are a helpful assistant,"" and the human message is ""{text}"".

5. **Create the chain and invoke it**: Use the `|` operator to create the chain from the prompt and the `ChatGroq` instance. Then, invoke the chain by passing the input text as a dictionary.

Alternatively, you can use the following JavaScript code to achieve the same result:

```javascript
import { ChatGroq } from ""@langchain/groq"";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from ""@langchain/core/prompts"";

const model = new ChatGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""],
  [""human"", ""{input}""],
]);
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const response = await chain.invoke({ input: ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs."" });
```

The key steps are similar to the Python example:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `@langchain/groq` and `@langchain/core/prompts` modules.
2. Create a `ChatGroq` instance, passing the API key as an option.
3. Define the prompt using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.
4. Create the chain by piping the prompt through the `ChatGroq` model.
5. Invoke the chain with the input text and await the response.

Both the Python and JavaScript examples demonstrate how to create a simple chain in LangChain using the Groq language model. The process involves initializing the Groq model, defining the prompt, and creating the chain to generate the desired output.","{""sources"":[{""metadata"":{""type"":""model_response"",""citations"":[{""end"":102,""text"":""LangCorn"",""start"":94,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_9""]},{""end"":129,""text"":""API server"",""start"":119,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_9""]},{""end"":187,""text"":""serve LangChain models and pipelines"",""start"":151,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_9""]},{""end"":229,""text"":""FastAPI framework."",""start"":211,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_9""]},{""end"":278,""text"":""installing LangCorn via pip"",""start"":251,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_9""]},{""end"":322,""text"":""creating your LangChain model and pipeline"",""start"":280,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0""]},{""end"":364,""text"":""running the LangCorn FastAPI server."",""start"":328,""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_9""]},{""end"":408,""text"":""official documentation"",""start"":386,""document_ids"":[""web-search_9""]},{""end"":463,""text"":""LangServe"",""start"":454,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":544,""text"":""deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API."",""start"":492,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":574,""text"":""integrated with FastAPI"",""start"":551,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":596,""text"":""client"",""start"":590,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":653,""text"":""call runnables deployed on a server."",""start"":617,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":683,""text"":""LangChain CLI"",""start"":670,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":725,""text"":""bootstrap a LangServe project quickly."",""start"":687,""document_ids"":[""web-search_1""]},{""end"":748,""text"":""Jina AI Cloud"",""start"":735,""document_ids"":[""web-search_7""]},{""end"":836,""text"":""deploy your LangChain apps on Jina AI Cloud in seconds."",""start"":781,""document_ids"":[""web-search_7""]},{""end"":879,""text"":""craft REST/Websocket APIs"",""start"":854,""document_ids"":[""web-search_7""]},{""end"":925,""text"":""deploy LLM-powered conversational Slack bots"",""start"":881,""document_ids"":[""web-search_7""]},{""end"":977,""text"":""wrap your LangChain apps into FastAPI packages"",""start"":931,""document_ids"":[""web-search_7""]},{""end"":1045,""text"":""Huggingface Via Docker"",""start"":1023,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1115,""text"":""Docker."",""start"":1108,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1161,""text"":""creating a new Docker Space"",""start"":1134,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1198,""text"":""setting up your FastAPI application"",""start"":1163,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1222,""text"":""Dockerfile"",""start"":1212,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1250,""text"":""using the application."",""start"":1228,""document_ids"":[""web-search_6""]},{""end"":1283,""text"":""create-fastapi-project"",""start"":1261,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":1345,""text"":""generate a FastAPI + Langchain project"",""start"":1307,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":1409,""text"":""add different functionalities."",""start"":1379,""document_ids"":[""web-search_3""]},{""end"":1432,""text"":""Vercel"",""start"":1426,""document_ids"":[""web-search_4"",""web-search_5""]},{""end"":1490,""text"":""few minutes"",""start"":1479,""document_ids"":[""web-search_4"",""web-search_5""]},{""end"":1528,""text"":""step-by-step Python tutorial."",""start"":1499,""document_ids"":[""web-search_4"",""web-search_5""]}],""token_count"":{""total_tokens"":20499,""billed_tokens"":19748,""prompt_tokens"":20158,""response_tokens"":341,""search_query_tokens"":6},""search_queries"":[{""text"":""deploy langchain to fastapi"",""generation_id"":""8263c747-49af-4c2e-8e58-ad55713748b9""}],""search_results"":[{""connector"":{""id"":""web-search""},""document_ids"":[""web-search_0"",""web-search_1"",""web-search_3"",""web-search_4"",""web-search_5"",""web-search_6"",""web-search_7"",""web-search_9""],""search_query"":{""text"":""deploy langchain to fastapi"",""generation_id"":""8263c747-49af-4c2e-8e58-ad55713748b9""}}],""relevance_score"":0.99989027},""pageContent"":""To deploy LangChain applications to FastAPI, there are a few methods you can follow:\n1. Using LangCorn: LangCorn is an API server that allows users to serve LangChain models and pipelines effortlessly using the FastAPI framework. The process involves installing LangCorn via pip, creating your LangChain model and pipeline, and running the LangCorn FastAPI server. You can refer to the official documentation for more details on using LangCorn.\n2. Using LangServe: LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API. It is integrated with FastAPI and provides a client that can be used to call runnables deployed on a server. You can use the LangChain CLI to bootstrap a LangServe project quickly.\n3. Using Jina AI Cloud: Langchain-serve enables you to deploy your LangChain apps on Jina AI Cloud in seconds. It allows you to craft REST/Websocket APIs, deploy LLM-powered conversational Slack bots, and wrap your LangChain apps into FastAPI packages on the cloud or on-premises.\n4. Deploying to Huggingface Via Docker: You can deploy your FastAPI application on Huggingface using Docker. The steps involve creating a new Docker Space, setting up your FastAPI application, writing the Dockerfile, and using the application. \n5. Using create-fastapi-project: This method helps you generate a FastAPI + Langchain project, which you can further modify to add different functionalities.\n6.

In this article, we will walk you through how to deploy LangCorn to Vercel.\n\nBefore diving into the details, let’s first understand what LangCorn (https://github.com/msoedov/langcorn) is. LangCorn is a high-performance, scalable, and robust API server developed to ease the deployment of LangChain models and pipelines. It is built on the FastAPI framework and supports custom pipelines and processing. In addition, it provides ready-to-use auth functionality and well-documented RESTful API endpoints.\n\nStep 1: Installation\n\nFirst things first, you need to install LangCorn. To do this, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. Here’s how you can install LangCorn:\n\npip install langcorn\n\nNow that you have installed LangCorn, the next step is to create your LangChain model and pipeline. Here’s an example of a LangChain model named ex1.py:\n\nimport os from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI os.environ[\""OPENAI_API_KEY\""] = os.environ.get(\""OPENAI_API_KEY\"", \""sk-********\"") llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)\n\nAfter creating your model, you can run your LangCorn FastAPI server with the following command:\n\nlangcorn server examples.ex1:chain\n\nYou can also run multiple chains with the following command:\n\npython -m langcorn server examples.ex1:chain examples.ex2:chain\n\nStep 3: Create FastAPI App\n\nThe next step is to create your FastAPI app. Here’s how you can do this:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app:FastAPI = create_service(\""examples.ex1:chain\"")\n\nAnd if you are working with multiple chains, you can do it this way:\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langcorn import create_service app: FastAPI = create_service( \""examples.ex1:chain\"", \""examples.ex2:chain\"", \""examples.ex3:chain\"", \""examples.ex4:sequential_chain\"", \""examples.ex5:conversation\"", \""examples.ex6:conversation_with_summary\"", )\n\nStep 4: Run LangCorn FastAPI server\n\nNow, it’s time to run your LangCorn FastAPI server. You can do this with the following command:\n\nuvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\nStep 5: Deploy to Vercel\n\nHaving your LangCorn FastAPI server running locally is great. However, to make your LangChain models and pipelines accessible to others, you need to deploy your server. Here, we will use Vercel, a popular platform for static sites and Serverless Functions.\n\n\""devCommand\"": This is the command that Vercel will use to start your application during development.\n\n\""builds\"": This is where you specify what Vercel should do to build your application. The \""src\"" property indicates the entry point for your application, and \""use\"" property denotes the builder.\n\n\""routes\"": This part is where you specify routing rules for your application. The \""src\"" property is the path of the request, and the \""dest\"" is the destination of the route.\n\nIn your case, you might want to create a vercel.json file in the root directory of your repository that looks something like this:\n\n{ \""devCommand\"": \""uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000\"", \""builds\"": [ { \""src\"": \""examples/app.py\"", \""use\"": \""@vercel/python\"" } ], \""routes\"": [ { \""src\"": \""/(.*)\"", \""dest\"": \""examples/app.py\"" } ] }\n\nSync your private GitHub repo with Vercel: Log into your Vercel account and head over to the Vercel dashboard. Click on the “New Project” button and select “Import Git Repository”. You’ll need to provide the URL of your private GitHub repository and grant Vercel access to it.\n\nConfigure the project: On the “Import Git Repository” page, Vercel will automatically fill in the “Project Name” field with the name of your repository. You can change this if you wish. Make sure that the “Root Directory” field is empty, and then click “Deploy”.\n\nDeployment: Vercel will now clone your repository, install any dependencies, run the build command, and then deploy your application. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL where you can access your live application.\n\nRemember, every time you push changes to the master branch of your GitHub repository, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your application.\n\nAnd that’s it! You have successfully deployed your LangCorn FastAPI application to Vercel.

The secrets file should be a .env file containing the secrets.\n\nlcserve deploy jcloud app --secrets .env\n\nLet's take an example of a simple app that uses OPENAI_API_KEY stored as secrets.\n\nThis app directory contains the following files:\n\n. ├── main.py # The app ├── jcloud.yml # JCloud deployment config file ├── README.md # This README file ├── requirements.txt # The requirements file for the app └── secrets.env # The secrets file containing the redis credentials\n\nNote secret.env in this directory is a dummy file. You should replace it with your own secrets after creating a Redis instance. (For example with Upstash), such as:\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx\n\nmain.py will look like:\n\n# main.py from lcserve import serving from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\""subject\""], template=\""Write me a short poem about {subject}?\"", ) @serving(openai_tracing=True) def poem(subject: str, **kwargs): tracing_handler = kwargs.get(\""tracing_handler\"") chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) return chain.run(subject)\n\nIn the above example, the app will use OPENAI_API_KEY provided by the secrets to interact with OpenAI.\n\nThen you can deploy using the following command and interact with the deployed endpoint.\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud main --secrets secrets.env\n\n⏱️ Trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously using @job decorator.\n\nlc-serve is a simple CLI that helps you to deploy your agents on Jina AI Cloud (JCloud)\n\nDeploy your app locally\n\nlc-serve deploy local app\n\nExport your app as Kubernetes YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind kubernetes --path .\n\nExport your app as Docker Compose YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind docker-compose --path .\n\nDeploy your app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app\n\nDeploy FastAPI app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>\n\nUpdate existing app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app --app-id <app-id>\n\nGet app status on JCloud\n\nlc-serve status <app-id>\n\nList all apps on JCloud\n\nRemove app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve remove <app-id>\n\nlc-serve pause <app-id>\n\nResume app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve resume <app-id>\n\n💡 JCloud Deployment\n\n⚙️ Configurations\n\nFor JCloud deployment, you can configure your application infrastructure by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option. The supported configurations are:\n\nInstance type (instance), as defined by Jina AI Cloud.\n\nMinimum number of replicas for your application (autoscale_min). Setting it 0 enables serverless.\n\nDisk size (disk_size), in GB. The default value is 1 GB.\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 1.5G\n\nYou can alternatively include a jcloud.yaml file in your application directory with the desired configurations. However, please note that if the --config option is explicitly used in the command line interface, the local jcloud.yaml file will be disregarded. The command line provided configuration file will take precedence.\n\nIf you don't provide a configuration file or a specific configuration isn't specified, the following default settings will be applied:\n\ninstance: C3 autoscale_min: 1 disk_size: 1G\n\nApplications hosted on JCloud are priced in two categories:\n\nBase credits are charged to ensure high availability for your application by maintaining at least one instance running continuously, ready to handle incoming requests. If you wish to stop the serving application, you can either remove the app completely or put it on pause, the latter allows you to resume the app serving based on persisted configurations (refer to lc-serve CLI section for more information). Both options will halt the consumption of credits.\n\nActual credits charged for base credits are calculated based on the instance type as defined by Jina AI Cloud.\n\nBy default, instance type C3 is used with a minimum of 1 instance and Amazon EFS disk of size 1G, which means that if your application is served on JCloud, you will be charged ~10 credits per hour.\n\nYou can change the instance type and the minimum number of instances by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option. For example, if you want to use instance type C4 with a minimum of 0 replicas, and 2G EFS disk, you can provide the following configuration file:\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 2G\n\nServing credits are charged when your application is actively serving incoming requests.\n\nActual credits charged for serving credits are calculated based on the credits for the instance type multiplied by the duration for which your application serves requests.\n\nYou are charged for each second your application is serving requests.\n\nTotal credits charged = Base credits + Serving credits. (Jina AI Cloud defines each credit as €0.005)\n\nConsider an HTTP application that has served requests for 10 minutes in the last hour and uses a custom config:\n\ninstance: C4 autoscale_min: 0 disk_size: 2G\n\nTotal credits per hour charged would be 3.33. The calculation is as follows:\n\nC4 instance has an hourly credit rate of 20. EFS has hourly credit rate of 0.104 per GB. Base credits = 0 + 2 * 0.104 = 0.208 (since `autoscale_min` is 0) Serving credits = 20 * 10/60 = 3.33 Total credits per hour = 0.208 + 3.33 = 3.538\n\nConsider a WebSocket application that had active connections for 20 minutes in the last hour and uses the default configuration.\n\ninstance: C3 autoscale_min: 1 disk_size: 1G\n\nTotal credits per hour charged would be 13.33. The calculation is as follows:\n\nC3 instance has an hourly credit rate of 10. EFS has hourly credit rate of 0.104 per GB. Base credits = 10 + 1 * 0.104 = 10.104 (since `autoscale_min` is 1) Serving credits = 10 * 20/60 = 3.33 Total credits per hour = 10.104 + 3.33 = 13.434\n\n❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nlc-serve command not found\n\nMy client that connects to the JCloud hosted App gets timed-out, what should I do?\n\nHow to pass environment variables to the app?\n\nJCloud deployment failed at pushing image to Jina Hubble, what should I do?\n\nDebug babyagi playground request/response for external integration\n\nlc-serve command not found\n\nlc-serve command is registered during langchain-serve installation. If you get command not found: lc-serve error, please replace lc-serve command with python -m lcserve & retry.\n\nMy client that connects to the JCloud hosted App gets timed-out, what should I do?\n\nIf you make long HTTP/ WebSocket requests, the default timeout value (2 minutes) might not be suitable for your use case. You can provide a custom timeout value during JCloud deployment by using the --timeout argument.\n\nAdditionally, for HTTP, you may also experience timeouts due to limitations in the OSS we used in langchain-serve. While we are working to permanently address this issue, we recommend using HTTP/1.1 in your client as a temporary workaround.\n\nFor WebSocket, please note that the connection will be closed if idle for more than 5 minutes.\n\nHow to pass environment variables to the app?\n\nWe provide 2 options to pass environment variables:\n\nUse --env during app deployment to load env variables from a .env file. For example, lc-serve deploy jcloud app --env some.env will load all env variables from some.env file and pass them to the app. These env variables will be available in the app as os.environ['ENV_VAR_NAME'].\n\nYou can also pass env variables while sending requests to the app both in HTTP and WebSocket. envs field in the request body is used to pass env variables. For example\n\n{ \""question\"": \""What is the meaning of life?\"", \""envs\"": { \""ENV_VAR_NAME\"": \""ENV_VAR_VALUE\"" } }\n\nJCloud deployment failed at pushing image to Jina Hubble, what should I do?\n\nPlease use --verbose and retry to get more information. If you are operating on computer with arm64 arch, please retry with --platform linux/amd64 so the image can be built correctly.\n\nDebug babyagi playground request/response for external integration\n\nExpand 1.

It provides a simple interface to any langchain app on and makes them super accessible to users a platform they're already comfortable with.\n\n✨ Ready to dive in?\n\nThere's a step-by-step guide in the repository to help you build your own bot for helping with reasoning.\n\nHere's another step-by-step guide to help you chat over own internal HR-realted documents (like onboarding, policies etc.) with your employees right inside your Slack workspace.\n\n🔐 Authorize your APIs\n\nTo add an extra layer of security, we can integrate any custom API authorization by adding a auth argument to the @serving decorator.\n\nfrom lcserve import serving def authorizer(token: str) -> Any: if not token == 'mysecrettoken': # Change this to add your own authorization logic raise Exception('Unauthorized') # Raise an exception if the request is not authorized return 'userid' # Return any user id or object @serving(auth=authorizer) def ask(question: str, **kwargs) -> str: auth_response = kwargs['auth_response'] # This will be 'userid' return ... @serving(websocket=True, auth=authorizer) async def talk(question: str, **kwargs) -> str: auth_response = kwargs['auth_response'] # This will be 'userid' return ...\n\n🤔 Gotchas about the auth function\n\nShould accept only one argument token.\n\nShould raise an Exception if the request is not authorized.\n\nCan return any object, which will be passed to the auth_response object under kwargs to the functions.\n\nExpects Bearer token in the Authorization header of the request.\n\nSample HTTP request with curl:\n\ncurl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:8080/ask' -H 'Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken' -d '{ \""question\"": \""...\"", \""envs\"": {} }'\n\nSample WebSocket request with wscat:\n\nwscat -H \""Authorization: Bearer mysecrettoken\"" -c ws://localhost:8080/talk\n\n🙋‍♂️ Enable streaming & human-in-the-loop (HITL) with WebSockets\n\nHITL for LangChain agents on production can be challenging since the agents are typically running on servers where humans don't have direct access. langchain-serve bridges this gap by enabling websocket APIs that allow for real-time interaction and feedback between the agent and a human operator.\n\nCheck out this example to see how you can enable HITL for your agents.\n\n📁 Persistent storage on Jina AI Cloud\n\nEvery app deployed on Jina AI Cloud gets a persistent storage (EFS) mounted locally which can be accessed via workspace kwarg in the @serving function.\n\nfrom lcserve import serving @serving def store(text: str, **kwargs): workspace: str = kwargs.get('workspace') path = f'{workspace}/store.txt' print(f'Writing to {path}') with open(path, 'a') as f: f.writelines(text + '\\n') return 'OK' @serving(websocket=True) async def stream(**kwargs): workspace: str = kwargs.get('workspace') websocket: WebSocket = kwargs.get('websocket') path = f'{workspace}/store.txt' print(f'Streaming {path}') async with aiofiles.open(path, 'r') as f: async for line in f: await websocket.send_text(line) return 'OK'\n\nHere, we are using the workspace to store the incoming text in a file via the REST endpoint and streaming the contents of the file via the WebSocket endpoint.\n\n🚀 Bring your own FastAPI app\n\nIf you already have a FastAPI app with pre-defined endpoints, you can use lc-serve to deploy it on Jina AI Cloud.\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud --app filename:app\n\nLet's take an example of a simple FastAPI app with directory structure\n\n. └── endpoints.py\n\n# endpoints.py from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\""/status\"") def read_root(): return {\""Hello\"": \""World\""} @app.get(\""/items/{item_id}\"") def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None): return {\""item_id\"": item_id, \""q\"": q}\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud --app endpoints:app\n\n🗝️ Using Secrets during Deployment\n\nYou can use secrets during app deployment by passing a secrets file to deployment with the --secrets flag. The secrets file should be a .env file containing the secrets.\n\nlcserve deploy jcloud app --secrets .env\n\nLet's take an example of a simple app that uses OPENAI_API_KEY stored as secrets.\n\nThis app directory contains the following files:\n\n. ├── main.py # The app ├── jcloud.yml # JCloud deployment config file ├── README.md # This README file ├── requirements.txt # The requirements file for the app └── secrets.env # The secrets file containing the redis credentials\n\nNote secret.env in this directory is a dummy file. You should replace it with your own secrets after creating a Redis instance. (For example with Upstash), such as:\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx\n\nmain.py will look like:\n\n# main.py from lcserve import serving from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[\""subject\""], template=\""Write me a short poem about {subject}?\"", ) @serving(openai_tracing=True) def poem(subject: str, **kwargs): tracing_handler = kwargs.get(\""tracing_handler\"") chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[tracing_handler]) return chain.run(subject)\n\nIn the above example, the app will use OPENAI_API_KEY provided by the secrets to interact with OpenAI.\n\nThen you can deploy using the following command and interact with the deployed endpoint.\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud main --secrets secrets.env\n\n⏱️ Trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to trigger one-time jobs to run asynchronously using @job decorator.\n\nlc-serve is a simple CLI that helps you to deploy your agents on Jina AI Cloud (JCloud)\n\nDeploy your app locally\n\nlc-serve deploy local app\n\nExport your app as Kubernetes YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind kubernetes --path .\n\nExport your app as Docker Compose YAML\n\nlc-serve export app --kind docker-compose --path .\n\nDeploy your app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app\n\nDeploy FastAPI app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud --app <app-name>:<app-object>\n\nUpdate existing app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve deploy jcloud app --app-id <app-id>\n\nGet app status on JCloud\n\nlc-serve status <app-id>\n\nList all apps on JCloud\n\nRemove app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve remove <app-id>\n\nlc-serve pause <app-id>\n\nResume app on JCloud\n\nlc-serve resume <app-id>\n\n💡 JCloud Deployment\n\n⚙️ Configurations\n\nFor JCloud deployment, you can configure your application infrastructure by providing a YAML configuration file using the --config option.

This exposes a simple UI to configure and invoke your runnable with streaming output and intermediate steps.\n\nThe playground supports widgets and can be used to test your runnable with different inputs. See the widgets section below for more details.\n\nIn addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration:\n\nLangServe also supports a chat-focused playground that opt into and use under /my_runnable/playground/. Unlike the general playground, only certain types of runnables are supported - the runnable's input schema must be a dict with either:\n\na single key, and that key's value must be a list of chat messages.\n\ntwo keys, one whose value is a list of messages, and the other representing the most recent message.\n\nWe recommend you use the first format.\n\nThe runnable must also return either an AIMessage or a string.\n\nTo enable it, you must set playground_type=\""chat\"", when adding your route. Here's an example:\n\n# Declare a chain prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (\""system\"", \""You are a helpful, professional assistant named Cob.\""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\""messages\""), ] ) chain = prompt | ChatAnthropic(model=\""claude-2\"") class InputChat(BaseModel): \""\""\""Input for the chat endpoint.\""\""\"" messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage]] = Field( ..., description=\""The chat messages representing the current conversation.\"", ) add_routes( app, chain.with_types(input_type=InputChat), enable_feedback_endpoint=True, enable_public_trace_link_endpoint=True, playground_type=\""chat\"", )\n\nIf you are using LangSmith, you can also set enable_feedback_endpoint=True on your route to enable thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons after each message, and enable_public_trace_link_endpoint=True to add a button that creates a public traces for runs. Note that you will also need to set the following environment variables:\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\""true\"" export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=\""YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\""YOUR_API_KEY\""\n\nHere's an example with the above two options turned on:\n\nNote: If you enable public trace links, the internals of your chain will be exposed. We recommend only using this setting for demos or testing.\n\nLangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via LangChain Expression Language) and legacy chains (inheriting from Chain). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the input_schema property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it.\n\nYou can deploy to AWS using the AWS Copilot CLI\n\ncopilot init --app [application-name] --name [service-name] --type 'Load Balanced Web Service' --dockerfile './Dockerfile' --deploy\n\nClick here to learn more.\n\nYou can deploy to Azure using Azure Container Apps (Serverless):\n\naz containerapp up --name [container-app-name] --source . --resource-group [resource-group-name] --environment [environment-name] --ingress external --target-port 8001 --env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key\n\nYou can find more info here\n\nYou can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command:\n\ngcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key\n\nDeploy using Infrastructure as Code​\n\nYou can deploy your LangServe server with Pulumi using your preferred general purpose language. Below are some quickstart examples for deploying LangServe to different cloud providers.\n\nThese examples are a good starting point for your own infrastructure as code (IaC) projects. You can easily modify them to suit your needs.\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-cs-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-go-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-py-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-ts-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-js-langserve\n\nCommunity Contributed​\n\nDeploy to Railway​\n\nExample Railway Repo\n\nLangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations.\n\nOpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces].\n\nLangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain\n\nExcept for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected.\n\nHandling Authentication​\n\nIf you need to add authentication to your server, please read Fast API's documentation about dependencies and security.\n\nThe below examples show how to wire up authentication logic LangServe endpoints using FastAPI primitives.\n\nYou are responsible for providing the actual authentication logic, the users table etc.\n\nIf you're not sure what you're doing, you could try using an existing solution Auth0.\n\nIf you're using add_routes, see examples here.\n\nAuth with add_routes: Simple authentication that can be applied across all endpoints associated with app. (Not useful on its own for implementing per user logic.)\n\nAuth with add_routes: Simple authentication mechanism based on path dependencies. (No useful on its own for implementing per user logic.)\n\nAuth with add_routes: Implement per user logic and auth for endpoints that use per request config modifier. (Note: At the moment, does not integrate with OpenAPI docs.)\n\nAlternatively, you can use FastAPI's middleware.\n\nUsing global dependencies and path dependencies has the advantage that auth will be properly supported in the OpenAPI docs page, but these are not sufficient for implement per user logic (e.g., making an application that can search only within user owned documents).\n\nIf you need to implement per user logic, you can use the per_req_config_modifier or APIHandler (below) to implement this logic.\n\nIf you need authorization or logic that is user dependent, specify per_req_config_modifier when using add_routes. Use a callable receives the raw Request object and can extract relevant information from it for authentication and authorization purposes.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with FastAPI and python, you can use LangServe's APIHandler.\n\nAuth with APIHandler: Implement per user logic and auth that shows how to search only within user owned documents.\n\nAPIHandler Shows how to use APIHandler instead of add_routes. This provides more flexibility for developers to define endpoints. Works well with all FastAPI patterns, but takes a bit more effort.\n\nIt's a bit more work, but gives you complete control over the endpoint definitions, so you can do whatever custom logic you need for auth.\n\nLLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level:\n\nThe file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint\n\nThe file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content)\n\nThe processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking\n\nIf significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool\n\nYou should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application.\n\nCurrently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (multipart/form-data is not supported yet).\n\nHere's an example that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable.\n\nRemember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint.\n\nCustom Input and Output Types​\n\nInput and Output types are defined on all runnables.\n\nYou can access them via the input_schema and output_schema properties.\n\nLangServe uses these types for validation and documentation.\n\nIf you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the with_types method.\n\nHere's a toy example to illustrate the idea:\n\nfrom typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: \""\""\""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything.\""\""\"" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_type=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable)\n\nCustom User Types​\n\nInherit from CustomUserType if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation.\n\nAt the moment, this type only works server side and is used to specify desired decoding behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict.\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: \""\""\""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model\""\""\"" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_type=Foo, # output_type=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=\""/foo\"")\n\nPlayground Widgets​\n\nThe playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nWidgets Different widgets that can be used with playground (file upload and chat)\n\nWidgets File upload widget used for LangServe playground.\n\nA widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type\n\nA widget must contain a key called type with the value being one of a well known list of widgets\n\nOther widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object\n\ntype JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; };\n\nAvailable Widgets​\n\nThere are only two widgets that the user can specify manually right now:\n\nSee below more information about these widgets.\n\nAll other widgets on the playground UI are created and managed automatically by the UI based on the config schema of the Runnable. When you create Configurable Runnables, the playground should create appropriate widgets for you to control the behavior.\n\nFile Upload Widget​\n\nAllows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here's the full example.\n\ntry: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): \""\""\""Request including a base64 encoded file.\""\""\"" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={\""widget\"": {\""type\"": \""base64file\""}}) num_chars: int = 100\n\nLook at the widget example.\n\nTo define a chat widget, make sure that you pass \""type\"": \""chat\"".\n\n\""input\"" is JSONPath to the field in the Request that has the new input message.\n\n\""output\"" is JSONPath to the field in the Response that has new output message(s).\n\nDon't specify these fields if the entire input or output should be used as they are ( e.g., if the output is a list of chat messages.)\n\nclass ChatHistory(CustomUserType): chat_history: List[Tuple[str, str]] = Field( ..., examples=[[(\""human input\"", \""ai response\"")]], extra={\""widget\"": {\""type\"": \""chat\"", \""input\"": \""question\"", \""output\"": \""answer\""}}, ) question: str def _format_to_messages(input: ChatHistory) -> List[BaseMessage]: \""\""\""Format the input to a list of messages.\""\""\"" history = input.chat_history user_input = input.question messages = [] for human, ai in history: messages.append(HumanMessage(content=human)) messages.append(AIMessage(content=ai)) messages.append(HumanMessage(content=user_input)) return messages model = ChatOpenAI() chat_model = RunnableParallel({\""answer\"": (RunnableLambda(_format_to_messages) | model)}) add_routes( app, chat_model.with_types(input_type=ChatHistory), config_keys=[\""configurable\""], path=\""/chat\"", )\n\nYou can also specify a list of messages as your a parameter directly, as shown in this snippet:\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (\""system\"", \""You are a helpful assisstant named Cob.\""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\""messages\""), ] ) chain = prompt | ChatAnthropic(model=\""claude-2\"") class MessageListInput(BaseModel): \""\""\""Input for the chat endpoint.\""\""\"" messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]] = Field( ..., description=\""The chat messages representing the current conversation.\"", extra={\""widget\"": {\""type\"": \""chat\"", \""input\"": \""messages\""}}, ) add_routes( app, chain.with_types(input_type=MessageListInput), path=\""/chat\"", )\n\nSee this sample file for an example.\n\nEnabling / Disabling Endpoints (LangServe >=0.0.33)​\n\nYou can enable / disable which endpoints are exposed when adding routes for a given chain.\n\nUse enabled_endpoints if you want to make sure to never get a new endpoint when upgrading langserve to a newer verison.\n\nEnable: The code below will only enable invoke, batch and the corresponding config_hash endpoint variants.\n\nadd_routes(app, chain, enabled_endpoints=[\""invoke\"", \""batch\"", \""config_hashes\""], path=\""/mychain\"")\n\nDisable: The code below will disable the playground for the chain\n\nadd_routes(app, chain, disabled_endpoints=[\""playground\""], path=\""/mychain\"")\n\nHelp us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:\n\nLangChain CLI 🛠️\n\nDeploy using Infrastructure as Code\n\nCommunity Contributed\n\nHandling Authentication\n\nCustom Input and Output Types\n\nEnabling / Disabling Endpoints (LangServe >=0.0.33)"",""timestamp"":""2024-03-14T20:38:38"",""relevance_score"":0.9983643},""pageContent"":""Skip to main content\n\n🦜️🏓 LangServe\n\n🚩 We will be releasing a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications.

If you want content at / define an endpoint @app.get(\""/\"").\n\nfrom langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableMap from langserve import RemoteRunnable openai = RemoteRunnable(\""http://localhost:8000/openai/\"") anthropic = RemoteRunnable(\""http://localhost:8000/anthropic/\"") joke_chain = RemoteRunnable(\""http://localhost:8000/joke/\"") joke_chain.invoke({\""topic\"": \""parrots\""}) # or async await joke_chain.ainvoke({\""topic\"": \""parrots\""}) prompt = [ SystemMessage(content='Act like either a cat or a parrot.'), HumanMessage(content='Hello!') ] # Supports astream async for msg in anthropic.astream(prompt): print(msg, end=\""\"", flush=True) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(\""system\"", \""Tell me a long story about {topic}\"")] ) # Can define custom chains chain = prompt | RunnableMap({ \""openai\"": openai, \""anthropic\"": anthropic, }) chain.batch([{\""topic\"": \""parrots\""}, {\""topic\"": \""cats\""}])\n\nIn TypeScript (requires LangChain.js version 0.0.166 or later):\n\nimport { RemoteRunnable } from \""@langchain/core/runnables/remote\""; const chain = new RemoteRunnable({ url: `http://localhost:8000/joke/`, }); const result = await chain.invoke({ topic: \""cats\"", });\n\nPython using requests:\n\nimport requests response = requests.post( \""http://localhost:8000/joke/invoke\"", json={'input': {'topic': 'cats'}} ) response.json()\n\nYou can also use curl:\n\ncurl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/joke/invoke' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{ \""input\"": { \""topic\"": \""cats\"" } }'\n\n... add_routes( app, runnable, path=\""/my_runnable\"", )\n\nadds of these endpoints to the server:\n\nPOST /my_runnable/invoke - invoke the runnable on a single input\n\nPOST /my_runnable/batch - invoke the runnable on a batch of inputs\n\nPOST /my_runnable/stream - invoke on a single input and stream the output\n\nPOST /my_runnable/stream_log - invoke on a single input and stream the output, including output of intermediate steps as it's generated\n\nPOST /my_runnable/astream_events - invoke on a single input and stream events as they are generated, including from intermediate steps.\n\nGET /my_runnable/input_schema - json schema for input to the runnable\n\nGET /my_runnable/output_schema - json schema for output of the runnable\n\nGET /my_runnable/config_schema - json schema for config of the runnable\n\nThese endpoints match the LangChain Expression Language interface -- please reference this documentation for more details.\n\nYou can find a playground page for your runnable at /my_runnable/playground/. This exposes a simple UI to configure and invoke your runnable with streaming output and intermediate steps.\n\nThe playground supports widgets and can be used to test your runnable with different inputs. See the widgets section below for more details.\n\nIn addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration:\n\nLangServe also supports a chat-focused playground that opt into and use under /my_runnable/playground/. Unlike the general playground, only certain types of runnables are supported - the runnable's input schema must be a dict with either:\n\na single key, and that key's value must be a list of chat messages.\n\ntwo keys, one whose value is a list of messages, and the other representing the most recent message.\n\nWe recommend you use the first format.\n\nThe runnable must also return either an AIMessage or a string.\n\nTo enable it, you must set playground_type=\""chat\"", when adding your route. Here's an example:\n\n# Declare a chain prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (\""system\"", \""You are a helpful, professional assistant named Cob.\""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\""messages\""), ] ) chain = prompt | ChatAnthropic(model=\""claude-2\"") class InputChat(BaseModel): \""\""\""Input for the chat endpoint.\""\""\"" messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage]] = Field( ..., description=\""The chat messages representing the current conversation.\"", ) add_routes( app, chain.with_types(input_type=InputChat), enable_feedback_endpoint=True, enable_public_trace_link_endpoint=True, playground_type=\""chat\"", )\n\nIf you are using LangSmith, you can also set enable_feedback_endpoint=True on your route to enable thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons after each message, and enable_public_trace_link_endpoint=True to add a button that creates a public traces for runs. Note that you will also need to set the following environment variables:\n\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\""true\"" export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=\""YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\""YOUR_API_KEY\""\n\nHere's an example with the above two options turned on:\n\nNote: If you enable public trace links, the internals of your chain will be exposed. We recommend only using this setting for demos or testing.\n\nLangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via LangChain Expression Language) and legacy chains (inheriting from Chain). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the input_schema property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it.\n\nYou can deploy to AWS using the AWS Copilot CLI\n\ncopilot init --app [application-name] --name [service-name] --type 'Load Balanced Web Service' --dockerfile './Dockerfile' --deploy\n\nClick here to learn more.\n\nYou can deploy to Azure using Azure Container Apps (Serverless):\n\naz containerapp up --name [container-app-name] --source . --resource-group [resource-group-name] --environment [environment-name] --ingress external --target-port 8001 --env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key\n\nYou can find more info here\n\nYou can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command:\n\ngcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key\n\nDeploy using Infrastructure as Code​\n\nYou can deploy your LangServe server with Pulumi using your preferred general purpose language. Below are some quickstart examples for deploying LangServe to different cloud providers.\n\nThese examples are a good starting point for your own infrastructure as code (IaC) projects. You can easily modify them to suit your needs.\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-cs-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-go-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-py-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-ts-langserve\n\nhttps://github.com/pulumi/examples/aws-js-langserve\n\nCommunity Contributed​\n\nDeploy to Railway​\n\nExample Railway Repo\n\nLangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations.\n\nOpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces].\n\nLangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain\n\nExcept for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected.\n\nHandling Authentication​\n\nIf you need to add authentication to your server, please read Fast API's documentation about dependencies and security.\n\nThe below examples show how to wire up authentication logic LangServe endpoints using FastAPI primitives.\n\nYou are responsible for providing the actual authentication logic, the users table etc.\n\nIf you're not sure what you're doing, you could try using an existing solution Auth0.\n\nIf you're using add_routes, see examples here.\n\nAuth with add_routes: Simple authentication that can be applied across all endpoints associated with app. (Not useful on its own for implementing per user logic.)\n\nAuth with add_routes: Simple authentication mechanism based on path dependencies. (No useful on its own for implementing per user logic.)\n\nAuth with add_routes: Implement per user logic and auth for endpoints that use per request config modifier. (Note: At the moment, does not integrate with OpenAPI docs.)\n\nAlternatively, you can use FastAPI's middleware.\n\nUsing global dependencies and path dependencies has the advantage that auth will be properly supported in the OpenAPI docs page, but these are not sufficient for implement per user logic (e.g., making an application that can search only within user owned documents).\n\nIf you need to implement per user logic, you can use the per_req_config_modifier or APIHandler (below) to implement this logic.\n\nIf you need authorization or logic that is user dependent, specify per_req_config_modifier when using add_routes. Use a callable receives the raw Request object and can extract relevant information from it for authentication and authorization purposes.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with FastAPI and python, you can use LangServe's APIHandler.\n\nAuth with APIHandler: Implement per user logic and auth that shows how to search only within user owned documents.\n\nAPIHandler Shows how to use APIHandler instead of add_routes. This provides more flexibility for developers to define endpoints. Works well with all FastAPI patterns, but takes a bit more effort.\n\nIt's a bit more work, but gives you complete control over the endpoint definitions, so you can do whatever custom logic you need for auth.\n\nLLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level:\n\nThe file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint\n\nThe file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content)\n\nThe processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking\n\nIf significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool\n\nYou should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application.\n\nCurrently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (multipart/form-data is not supported yet).\n\nHere's an example that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable.\n\nRemember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint.\n\nCustom Input and Output Types​\n\nInput and Output types are defined on all runnables.\n\nYou can access them via the input_schema and output_schema properties.\n\nLangServe uses these types for validation and documentation.\n\nIf you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the with_types method.\n\nHere's a toy example to illustrate the idea:\n\nfrom typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: \""\""\""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything.\""\""\"" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_type=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable)\n\nCustom User Types​\n\nInherit from CustomUserType if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation.\n\nAt the moment, this type only works server side and is used to specify desired decoding behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict.\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: \""\""\""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model\""\""\"" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_type=Foo, # output_type=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=\""/foo\"")\n\nPlayground Widgets​\n\nThe playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nWidgets Different widgets that can be used with playground (file upload and chat)\n\nWidgets File upload widget used for LangServe playground.\n\nA widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type\n\nA widget must contain a key called type with the value being one of a well known list of widgets\n\nOther widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object\n\ntype JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; };\n\nAvailable Widgets​\n\nThere are only two widgets that the user can specify manually right now:\n\nSee below more information about these widgets.\n\nAll other widgets on the playground UI are created and managed automatically by the UI based on the config schema of the Runnable. When you create Configurable Runnables, the playground should create appropriate widgets for you to control the behavior.\n\nFile Upload Widget​\n\nAllows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here's the full example.\n\ntry: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): \""\""\""Request including a base64 encoded file.\""\""\"" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={\""widget\"": {\""type\"": \""base64file\""}}) num_chars: int = 100\n\nLook at the widget example.\n\nTo define a chat widget, make sure that you pass \""type\"": \""chat\"".\n\n\""input\"" is JSONPath to the field in the Request that has the new input message.\n\n\""output\"" is JSONPath to the field in the Response that has new output message(s).\n\nDon't specify these fields if the entire input or output should be used as they are ( e.g., if the output is a list of chat messages.)\n\nclass ChatHistory(CustomUserType): chat_history: List[Tuple[str, str]] = Field( ..., examples=[[(\""human input\"", \""ai response\"")]], extra={\""widget\"": {\""type\"": \""chat\"", \""input\"": \""question\"", \""output\"": \""answer\""}}, ) question: str def _format_to_messages(input: ChatHistory) -> List[BaseMessage]: \""\""\""Format the input to a list of messages.\""\""\"" history = input.chat_history user_input = input.question messages = [] for human, ai in history: messages.append(HumanMessage(content=human)) messages.append(AIMessage(content=ai)) messages.append(HumanMessage(content=user_input)) return messages model = ChatOpenAI() chat_model = RunnableParallel({\""answer\"": (RunnableLambda(_format_to_messages) | model)}) add_routes( app, chat_model.with_types(input_type=ChatHistory), config_keys=[\""configurable\""], path=\""/chat\"", )\n\nYou can also specify a list of messages as your a parameter directly, as shown in this snippet:\n\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (\""system\"", \""You are a helpful assisstant named Cob.\""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\""messages\""), ] ) chain = prompt | ChatAnthropic(model=\""claude-2\"") class MessageListInput(BaseModel): \""\""\""Input for the chat endpoint.\""\""\"" messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]] = Field( ..., description=\""The chat messages representing the current conversation.\"", extra={\""widget\"": {\""type\"": \""chat\"", \""input\"": \""messages\""}}, ) add_routes( app, chain.with_types(input_type=MessageListInput), path=\""/chat\"", )\n\nSee this sample file for an example.\n\nEnabling / Disabling Endpoints (LangServe >=0.0.33)​\n\nYou can enable / disable which endpoints are exposed when adding routes for a given chain.\n\nUse enabled_endpoints if you want to make sure to never get a new endpoint when upgrading langserve to a newer verison.\n\nEnable: The code below will only enable invoke, batch and the corresponding config_hash endpoint variants.\n\nadd_routes(app, chain, enabled_endpoints=[\""invoke\"", \""batch\"", \""config_hashes\""], path=\""/mychain\"")\n\nDisable: The code below will disable the playground for the chain\n\nadd_routes(app, chain, disabled_endpoints=[\""playground\""], path=\""/mychain\"")\n\nHelp us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:\n\nLangChain CLI 🛠️\n\nDeploy using Infrastructure as Code\n\nCommunity Contributed\n\nHandling Authentication\n\nCustom Input and Output Types\n\nEnabling / Disabling Endpoints (LangServe >=0.0.33)""},{""metadata"":{""id"":""web-search_9"",""url"":""https://github.com/msoedov/langcorn"",""title"":""GitHub - msoedov/langcorn: ⛓️ Serving LangChain LLM apps and agents automagically with FastApi.

1. **Using LangCorn**: LangCorn is an API server that allows users to serve LangChain models and pipelines effortlessly using the FastAPI framework. The process involves installing LangCorn via pip, creating your LangChain model and pipeline, and running the LangCorn FastAPI server. You can refer to the [official LangCorn documentation](https://github.com/msoedov/langcorn) for more details on using LangCorn.

```python
# Example using LangCorn
import os
from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI
from langcorn import create_service

os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = os.environ.get(""OPENAI_API_KEY"", ""sk-********"")
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)

app = create_service(""examples.ex1:chain"")
```

2. **Using LangServe**: LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API. It is integrated with FastAPI and provides a client that can be used to call runnables deployed on a server. You can use the [LangChain CLI](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-cli) to bootstrap a LangServe project quickly.

```python
# Example using LangServe
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langserve import create_service
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

app = FastAPI()
chat = ChatOpenAI()
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant."")])
chain = prompt | chat

app = create_service(app, chain, path=""/chat"")
```

3. **Using Jina AI Cloud**: [Langchain-serve](https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain-serve) enables you to deploy your LangChain apps on Jina AI Cloud in seconds. It allows you to craft REST/Websocket APIs, deploy LLM-powered conversational Slack bots, and wrap your LangChain apps into FastAPI packages on the cloud or on-premises.

4. **Deploying to Huggingface Via Docker**: You can deploy your FastAPI application on Huggingface using Docker. The steps involve creating a new Docker Space, setting up your FastAPI application, writing the Dockerfile, and using the application.

5. **Using create-fastapi-project**: This method helps you generate a FastAPI + Langchain project, which you can further modify to add different functionalities.

6. **Deploying to Vercel**: You can deploy LangChain apps to Vercel in a few minutes using a [step-by-step Python tutorial](https://medium.com/meta-heuristic/deploying-langchain-with-fastapi-to-vercel-your-step-by-step-guide-d7bb0de5baf).

The choice of method depends on your specific requirements, preferences, and the infrastructure you're working with. Each approach has its own advantages and limitations, so you should evaluate them based on your project's needs.",

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq

# Initialize the ChatGroq class
chat = ChatGroq(temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-32768"")

# Create a ChatPromptTemplate
system = ""You are a helpful assistant.""
human = ""{text}""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])

# Create the chain and invoke it
chain = prompt | chat
chain.invoke({""text"": ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.""})
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: First, install the `langchain-groq` package, which provides the integration between LangChain and the Groq language model.

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. **Import the required classes**: Import the `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts` and the `ChatGroq` class from `langchain_groq`.

3. **Initialize the ChatGroq class**: Create an instance of the `ChatGroq` class, specifying the temperature and the model name you want to use. In this example, we're using the ""mixtral-8x7b-32768"" model.

4. **Create a ChatPromptTemplate**: Define the system and human messages that will be used to create the prompt. In this case, the system message is ""You are a helpful assistant,"" and the human message is ""{text}"".

5. **Create the chain and invoke it**: Use the `|` operator to create the chain from the prompt and the `ChatGroq` instance. Then, invoke the chain by passing the input text as a dictionary.

Alternatively, you can use the following JavaScript code to achieve the same result:

```javascript
import { ChatGroq } from ""@langchain/groq"";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from ""@langchain/core/prompts"";

const model = new ChatGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""],
  [""human"", ""{input}""],
]);
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const response = await chain.invoke({ input: ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs."" });
```

The key steps are similar to the Python example:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `@langchain/groq` and `@langchain/core/prompts` modules.
2. Create a `ChatGroq` instance, passing the API key as an option.
3. Define the prompt using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.
4. Create the chain by piping the prompt through the `ChatGroq` model.
5. Invoke the chain with the input text and await the response.

Both the Python and JavaScript examples demonstrate how to create a simple chain in LangChain using the Groq language model. The process involves initializing the Groq model, defining the prompt, and creating the chain to generate the desired output. ",[],"To deploy a FastAPI application, you can follow these steps:

1. **Package your application**: Ensure that your FastAPI application is packaged correctly, with all the necessary files, dependencies, and configurations.

2. **Choose a deployment platform**: There are several options for deploying a FastAPI application, such as:
   - **Uvicorn**: Uvicorn is a popular ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that can be used to run your FastAPI application. It's a lightweight and fast server that can be easily deployed.
   - **Docker**: You can package your FastAPI application into a Docker container, which can then be deployed to various hosting platforms, such as AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean.

3. **Deploy using Uvicorn**:
   1. Install Uvicorn:
      ```
      pip install uvicorn
      ```
   2. Create a `wsgi.py` (or any other name) file in your project's root directory with the following content:
      ```python
      from your_app_module import app

      if __name__ == ""__main__"":
          import uvicorn
          uvicorn.run(app, host=""0.0.0.0"", port=8000)
      ```
      Replace `your_app_module` with the actual name of the module containing your FastAPI application.
   3. Run the application using Uvicorn:
      ```
      uvicorn wsgi:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
      ```

4. **Deploy using Docker**:
   1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project's root directory with the following content:
      ```Dockerfile
      FROM python:3.9

      WORKDIR /app

```
",[],"To deploy a LangChain with a Groq model using FastAPI, you first need to install the necessary packages. You can create a new virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain-groq
```

Next, create a Python script (e.g., `main.py`) based on the provided context and the FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title=""GroqChain Server"", version=""1.0"")

@app.post(""/invoke"")
async def invoke(input_data: Input):
    result = groq_chain.invoke(input_data.dict())
    return result

Now, you can run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])

# Create the chain and invoke it
chain = prompt | chat
chain.invoke({""text"": ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.""})
```

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: First, install the `langchain-groq` package, which provides the integration between LangChain and the Groq language model.

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. **Import the required classes**: Import the `ChatPromptTemplate` from `langchain_core.prompts` and the `ChatGroq` class from `langchain_groq`.

3. **Initialize the ChatGroq class**: Create an instance of the `ChatGroq` class, specifying the temperature and the model name you want to use. In this example, we're using the ""mixtral-8x7b-32768"" model.

4. **Create a ChatPromptTemplate**: Define the system and human messages that will be used to create the prompt. In this case, the system message is ""You are a helpful assistant,"" and the human message is ""{text}"".

5. **Create the chain and invoke it**: Use the `|` operator to create the chain from the prompt and the `ChatGroq` instance. Then, invoke the chain by passing the input text as a dictionary.

Alternatively, you can use the following JavaScript code to achieve the same result:

```javascript
import { ChatGroq } from ""@langchain/groq"";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from ""@langchain/core/prompts"";

const model = new ChatGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""],
  [""human"", ""{input}""],
]);
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const response = await chain.invoke({ input: ""Explain the importance of low latency LLMs."" });
```

The key steps are similar to the Python example:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `@langchain/groq` and `@langchain/core/prompts` modules.
2. Create a `ChatGroq` instance, passing the API key as an option.
3. Define the prompt using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.
4. Create the chain by piping the prompt through the `ChatGroq` model.
5. Invoke the chain with the input text and await the response.

Both the Python and JavaScript examples demonstrate how to create a simple chain in LangChain using the Groq language model. The process involves initializing the Groq model, defining the prompt, and creating the chain to generate the desired output.

Here's a server that deploys an OpenAI chat model, an Anthropic chat model, and a chain that uses the Anthropic model to tell a joke about a topic.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI
from langserve import add_routes

app = FastAPI(
    title=""LangChain Server"",
    version=""1.0"",
    description=""A simple api server using Langchain's Runnable interfaces"",
)

add_routes(
    app,
    ChatOpenAI(),
    path=""/openai"",
)

add_routes(
    app,
    ChatAnthropic(),
    path=""/anthropic"",
)

model = ChatAnthropic()
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"")
add_routes(
    app,
    prompt | model,
    path=""/joke"",
)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn

    uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000)
```
",[],"To deploy the Groq chain with `langserve`, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have the `langchain-groq` package installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

2. Create a Python script (e.g., `groq_chain.py`) and import the necessary classes from `langchain_groq` and `langchain_core.prompts`:

```python
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
```

3. Initialize the `ChatGroq` class and create a `ChatPromptTemplate` instance:

```python
chat = ChatGroq(temperature=0, model_name=""mixtral-8x7b-32768"")
system = ""You are a helpful assistant.""
human = ""{text}""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(""system"", system), (""human"", human)])
```

4. Create the chain and wrap it in a function:

```python
def groq_chain(text):
    chain = prompt | chat
    return chain.invoke({""text"": text})
```

5. In your `langserve` script, import the necessary modules and create a function to add the Groq chain:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Any

app = FastAPI(
    title=""LangChain Server"",
    version=""1.0"",
    description=""A simple api server using Langchain's Runnable interfaces"",
)

def add_groq_chain(app: FastAPI, path: str):
    class GroqChainInput(BaseModel):
        text: str

    @app.post(path)
    async def groq_chain_handler(input_data: GroqChainInput) -> Any:
        result = groq_chain(input_data.text)
        return result
```

6. Call the `add_groq_chain` function in your `langserve` script:

```python
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn

    add_groq_chain(app, path=""/groq"")
    uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000)
```

Now, when you run your `langserve` script, you should be able to send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/groq` with a JSON payload containing the `text` field, and the Groq chain will be invoked.

Note: Make sure you have the `groq_chain` function and the `chat` and `prompt` variables defined in the same scope as the `add_groq_chain` function.",

",[],"To deploy the Groq chain with Langserve's `add_routes` function, you first need to create a Langchain server that supports the Groq language model. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. **Create a custom chat model class for Groq**: You can create a custom chat model class that inherits from `BaseChatModel` and implements the necessary methods to interact with the Groq language model.

```python
from typing import Any
from langchain.chat_models.base import BaseChatModel

class GroqChatModel(BaseChatModel):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        # Initialize the Groq language model here
        # You can use any library or API to interact with the Groq model
        pass

    async def _generate(self, messages: list[dict[str, str]], stop: list[str], **kwargs: Any) -> str:
        # Implement the generate method to call the Groq language model
        # You can use any library or API to interact with the Groq model
        pass
```

2. **Create a custom prompt template for the Groq chain**: You can create a custom prompt template for the Groq chain using the `ChatPromptTemplate` class.

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"")
```

3. **Create a chain with the Groq model and the custom prompt**: You can create a chain by piping the custom prompt through the `GroqChatModel` instance.

```python
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain

chain = prompt | GroqChatModel()
```

4. **Add the Groq chain to the Langchain server**: You can use the `add_routes` function from `langserve` to add the Groq chain to the Langchain server.

```python
from langserve import add_routes

add_routes(
    app,
    chain,
    path=""/groq"",
)
```

Here's the complete example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models.base import BaseChatModel
from langserve import add_routes

app = FastAPI(
    title=""LangChain Server"",
    version=""1.0"",
    description=""A simple api server using Langchain's Runnable interfaces"",
)

class GroqChatModel(BaseChatModel):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        pass

    async def _generate(self, messages: list[dict[str, str]], stop: list[str], **kwargs: Any) -> str:
        # Implement the generate method to call the Groq language model
        pass

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"")
chain = prompt | GroqChatModel()

add_routes(
    app,
    chain,
    path=""/groq"",
)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    import uvicorn

    uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000)
```

Note: You need to implement the `_generate` method in the `GroqChatModel` class to call the Groq language model. You can use any library or API to interact with the Groq model.",
